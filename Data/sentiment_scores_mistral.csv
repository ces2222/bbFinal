1,"June 17 , 1970 Summary of Findings Sixth District directors have mixed opinions about future business conditions . If any consensus exists , it is that the economy has not yet bottomed out and that recovery will be less than spectacular when it comes . According to directors ' reports and other sources of information , further weakening in sales , employment and production is likely . Department stores report lower volume and growing resistance to higher priced merchandise . Belt tightening by businesses has spread , and directors report many instances of slowdowns in capital spending . Employment and production cutbacks are common . Retail sales Department stores surveyed report no discernible shift from the `` upstairs '' to the `` bargain basement '' .

Regarding auto sales , distributors contacted report some shifting from larger cars to the compact sized , loaded with optional equipment . Rather than settling for a stripped-down version of a full-sized car , customers are purchasing lower priced equipment-packed models .

2,"of jewelry manufacturers in southern Massachusetts and northern Rhode Island report that 1970 sales levels to date are brisk . The textile industry , concentrated in the same area , has experienced a dramatic increase in demand for products associated with home sewing , reflecting the heightened consumer cost consciousness noted elsewhere this year . The New England machine tool industry , on the other hand , continues in a severely depressed situation with no letup in sight . Several regional producers of chemical and mineral inputs into housing associated products ( e.g. , paints , carpets , linoleum , etc . ) now discern a turnaround in demand as having occurred four to eight weeks ago . Regional labor markets , as noted in earlier reports , are softer than they have been for some years . This easing apparently extends into both blue- and white-collar groups . The views of our academic consultants have perhaps converged same since earlier in the summer . Professor Paul Samuelson feels certain that the economic turnaround is behind us , and that the slowdown has been sufficiently mild that it will escape official NBER designation as a recession . '' As a weak contraction tends to be followed by a sluggish expansion , Samuelson expressed concern that the existent real GNP gap will widen further over the next four quarters .

Since a growth in real output of about 4 percent is necessary to avoid this , he concludes that authorities should permit a monetary expansion great enough",0.3,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:41:55.0942557Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 1777, 26296, 20013, 1065, 12995, 17023, 1072, 13495, 11050, 1341, 8401, 3032, 1137, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29502, 7060, 6925, 1066, 4376, 1228, 1938, 3374, 1610, 1183, 3013, 1314, 5547, 1968, 25856, 1065, 1040, 2116, 3466, 1968, 1427, 9072, 1032, 18064, 6015, 1065, 6405, 1122, 4844, 6131, 1163, 2379, 1195, 10756, 1968, 8735, 1056, 1040, 5878, 2874, 12845, 3202, 17276, 9427, 15584, 1224, 1647, 1610, 1183, 2218, 6551, 6367, 4689, 5547, 1968, 1124, 1040, 1567, 1789, 1968, 11120, 1065, 1032, 28832, 28464, 5388, 1163, 1476, 2114, 1483, 1065, 8507, 1610, 15991, 12676, 23630, 1070, 11613, 1072, 26605, 15159, 1546, 12589, 6131, 4844, 1093, 1085, 29491, 29489, 29491, 1968, 4126, 1842, 1968, 2021, 29488, 2236, 1968, 13661, 2022, 1151, 1968, 5113, 1610, 1911, 1823, 3080, 1941, 1032, 2295, 21654, 1065, 6405, 1158, 3229, 10662, 3076, 1066, 6203, 5355, 4352, 1610, 19486, 8347, 12342, 1968, 1158, 9427, 1065, 6353, 8727, 1968, 1228, 1347, 1578, 1589, 1358, 1274, 1518, 1122, 1509, 2035, 1610, 1619, 2665, 1056, 11364, 5744, 1546, 2328, 5813, 29501, 1072, 3843, 29501, 11689, 1051, 5706, 1610, 1183, 8812, 1070, 1581, 12628, 8499, 2317, 1274, 5998, 9873, 3328, 2116, 2622, 6353, 1065, 1040, 6329, 1610, 12730, 4688, 4925, 29486, 15582, 9083, 3320, 1137, 1040, 7406, 2295, 21654, 1117, 3678, 1360, 1968, 1072, 1137, 1040, 4712, 4022, 1427, 1518, 21322, 17351, 1137, 1146, 1390, 9725, 5957, 1186, 17587, 3389, 1120, 1158, 1032, 1705, 2661, 1610, 10610, 1904, 1032, 7102, 4956, 2542, 22515, 1066, 1115, 5729, 1254, 1032, 1903, 23833, 1557, 11888, 1968, 4925, 29486, 15582, 12326, 5136, 1137, 1040, 3356, 1076, 2121, 1188, 25025, 11235, 1390, 1043, 7435, 4397, 1522, 1040, 2447, 3076, 22910, 1610, 781, 781, 24859, 1032, 6825, 1065, 2121, 4593, 1070, 1452, 29473, 29549, 4921, 1117, 5660, 1066, 5229, 1224, 1968, 1168, 6001, 6655, 1137, 13271, 1791, 13516, 1032, 2094, 23869, 11888, 2366, 2834, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29538, 29520], 'total_duration': 2575623900, 'prompt_eval_count': 358, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1003182000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1566002000}"

4,"over the slowness of payments on receivables by business creditors , but it is generally recognized that , in most cases , the situation reflects the high cost of funds and restricted liquidity , rather than actual distress . Price increases for durable goods continue to be about as numerous as in recent months , and there is no clear evidence of a diminution of the rate of rise of prices of finished goods . Rising costs and unsatisfactory volume are causing transportation firms to push regulatory authorities for appreciable increases in rates in hopes of improving earnings . Job markets continue to soften as indicated by unemployment compensation claims , and reports of restricted hiring practices . Increasingly , skilled workers such as machinists , teachers , and other professional types are listed among those seeking work . Lists of unfilled job openings are the smallest since the early Sixties . Despite the improved labor supply picture , wage and pension demands continue large and are backed by militant worker organizations in state and local governments as well as in factories , utilities , and transportation companies . Local strikes are frequent and prolonged . The likelihood of a major strike this Fall , not only in the auto industry , but also in the farm and construction machinery industries , is taken virtually for granted .

The embargo on truck shipments of components and finished goods to and from the Chicago area , of course , continues to hamper output in other parts of the country .

6,"July 15 , 1970 Economic activity in the Fourth District improved in June , partly reflecting the termination of major strikes . The results of our most recent survey of manufacturers indicate that a more than usual seasonal decline in business conditions may develop in July in the district , although the bunching of plant-wide shutdowns for vacations at this time of year makes the data unusually difficult to interpret . Our directors remain generally pessimistic about the near-term economic outlook , although some of the industrialists feel that economic conditions may be a little better now than in previous months . In response to our question about price developments , we received a few reports of price discounting , but the consensus of our directors and a limited sample of business economists in the district was that prices will remain firm because of strong upward wage pressures . The improvement in economic conditions in the district in June was largely the result of the resumption of production and shipments following work stoppages in the area . The seasonally adjusted rate of insured unemployment for the district declined in June , and at month-end was approximately halfway between the pre-trucking strike level of March and the peak reached in mid-May . Steel ingot production in the district recovered in June after having declined in April and May .

In comparison with the 1969 holiday season , the majority of retailers reported that they expect a heavier volume of sales this year . Three of the retailers expected a substantially heavier volume , eleven expected a slightly heavier volume , seven expected sales to be about the same as in the 1969 season , while only three felt sales might be slightly lighter this year . In the way of general comments , one retailer noted that consumer sentiment was low due to the economic situation but expected relief during the fourth quarter and early in 1971 . One noted that if the General Motors strike continued , plus the massive layoffs at Texas Instruments , Ling-Temco-Vought , General Dynamics and Ford , that holiday sales could be softer than are now anticipated . One retailer indicated he was taking a `` lean bull '' position and expected October through April to be very strong for retail sales .",0.5,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:42:07.2155434Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.5}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 2246, 1054, 29501, 7396, 1172, 1228, 1983, 6403, 1070, 4912, 9763, 1206, 1224, 1495, 1610, 1328, 11135, 1163, 1040, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29552, 29542, 12778, 4070, 1968, 1040, 8525, 1070, 12371, 1172, 6513, 1137, 1358, 2443, 1032, 10193, 1517, 8299, 1070, 7060, 1224, 1647, 1610, 10441, 1070, 1040, 12371, 1172, 4117, 1032, 11651, 2697, 10193, 1517, 8299, 1968, 20574, 4117, 1032, 7959, 10193, 1517, 8299, 1968, 7439, 4117, 7060, 1066, 1115, 1452, 1040, 2116, 1158, 1065, 1040, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29552, 29542, 4070, 1968, 2080, 1633, 2480, 3538, 7060, 2427, 1115, 7959, 24413, 1224, 1647, 1610, 1328, 1040, 1837, 1070, 3720, 8384, 1968, 1392, 12371, 1031, 9427, 1137, 12845, 22558, 1171, 3627, 3708, 1066, 1040, 7406, 5388, 1330, 4117, 11621, 2706, 1040, 10804, 9017, 1072, 3703, 1065, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29508, 1610, 3155, 9427, 1137, 1281, 1040, 4360, 9622, 1502, 12872, 6085, 1968, 4053, 1040, 9898, 5665, 15335, 1206, 8594, 1328, 1810, 3873, 1968, 1161, 1056, 29501, 29506, 1134, 1883, 29501, 29558, 2090, 1968, 4360, 1152, 26473, 1072, 12869, 1968, 1137, 12778, 7060, 1597, 1115, 1347, 1578, 1589, 1228, 1823, 25792, 1610, 3155, 12371, 1031, 14843, 1168, 1171, 4112, 1032, 5776, 6883, 11154, 10610, 3608, 1072, 4117, 5295, 1827, 4767, 1066, 1115, 1983, 3735, 1122, 12371, 7060, 1610, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29550, 29520], 'total_duration': 2385704800, 'load_duration': 2475000, 'prompt_eval_count': 262, 'prompt_eval_duration': 812503000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1568775000}"
8,"October 14 , 1970 There is evidence that future growth in large CD 's at Tenth District banks will be less . There are indications also that business loan demand may be easing slightly . The labor situation in the Kansas City area has worsened as the construction strike—now in its seventh month—continues and the General Motors strike prevails at several large GM assembly plants . The reduction in output of feed grains and high feed-grain prices is likely to have an impact on the WPI and CPI within several months . Instead of providing a downward pressure on these indices which occurred from March to August , farm prices may again exert upward pressure later this year or early next year . Those large District banks which have actively sought large CD 's ( many have not ) have continued to attract substantial amounts of funds . Growth rates of outstanding CD 's have been comparable to those at large banks in New York City and Chicago . One peculiarity in the Tenth District has been that a significant amount of CD funds have come from state and local governmental units—about one-third of the total growth in CD 's . This source of funds would seem to be limited , so that future growth of CD 's may slow . Despite the rapid growth of CD ' s , most of the District banks so far have retained bank-affiliate commercial paper as a source of funds .

With the recent difficulties in the mid-east , tanker rates have increased by as much as 300 per cent , and imported crude now sells at about 75 cents per barrel above domestic crude on the east coast . Thus , domestic crude prices are under pressure , and at least one oil company has announced price increases in the Tenth District . Business is slow for District farm implement dealers . Inventories are relatively large , and cases of price cutting are not uncommon . Collections on credit sales are reported to be noticeably slower than last year . The interrelatedness of Tenth District economic activity with both national and international business conditions is illustrated by the experience of a Kansas City manufacturer of bottling and automatic vending equipment . This firm 's total business is about unchanged from a year ago , with increasing international business about offsetting a definite decline in domestic sales . The decline in domestic sales is attributed to reduced overtime and lower employment in factories with vending machines , as vending machine operators drop routes and defer the purchase of new equipment . There is some concern within the firm that their growing international business will be hurt by retaliations against U. S. restrictions on imports .

If his expectation is borne out , GM dealers in the District will probably run short of parts and new autos , as inventory shortages are already becoming apparent . The Northwest Airlines strike is also having scattered effects throughout the District . A few firms servicing Northwest Airlines have furloughed employees , and a number of retail establishments have experienced noticeable sales reductions . In addition , Northwest Airlines has cut their flight schedules because of the strike , and as a result landing fees to a number of airports in the District have been drastically reduced . These landing fees are important contributions to airport sinking funds , and in at least one case so far , these reductions have become especially troublesome . Ninth District bankers are still experiencing strong demands for loanable funds , according to information gathered during go-around sessions with both directors and officers of this bank . The continued strong loan demand seems to be general throughout the District as no one cited a case where loan demand had diminished . On the contrary , numerous instances were cited where demand had actually strengthened and non-financial businesses had taken further steps to economize on the use of funds .

Moreover , those steel economists that were contacted felt that inventory stockpiling by steel users against the possibility of a strike in the steel industry next year would begin later than during previous strike-hedging periods , with the `` big push '' coming",-0.5,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:42:23.920358Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.5}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 14200, 1513, 8299, 1070, 7060, 1065, 3243, 10552, 11626, 1422, 1828, 29473, 29508, 29502, 4921, 1245, 1032, 1647, 4352, 1610, 2186, 1040, 1567, 1789, 1968, 12371, 1172, 1065, 1509, 5373, 29589, 4269, 2220, 1968, 14410, 1968, 19815, 1968, 6452, 3006, 29589, 6587, 1122, 1032, 6632, 14972, 1522, 2200, 1647, 1232, 29481, 12778, 7060, 1610, 1904, 1065, 4222, 4138, 1968, 10610, 1828, 5085, 1056, 10610, 1968, 1072, 5776, 22845, 1194, 17036, 10610, 8336, 1065, 6334, 1968, 1072, 5105, 1492, 5968, 5675, 6085, 1066, 2993, 24890, 1610, 23070, 5653, 8288, 7102, 1610, 5590, 20013, 29098, 6513, 1476, 3036, 1210, 1509, 18236, 1158, 7499, 1163, 2200, 2870, 1065, 4593, 1968, 7060, 1968, 1072, 1401, 9404, 1072, 1968, 1065, 3720, 1968, 1681, 1122, 1633, 1032, 23419, 3856, 1483, 1065, 1040, 4292, 4138, 1610, 10212, 4712, 4022, 29481, 1422, 15653, 1065, 1040, 6367, 7808, 1968, 13944, 1968, 1072, 2723, 7876, 18677, 1093, 28654, 1065, 1040, 9911, 1072, 9217, 8975, 29481, 1911, 1072, 1065, 1040, 1032, 11435, 3412, 1072, 5872, 1305, 18677, 1093, 4420, 10454, 1911, 1968, 1330, 1040, 19056, 1603, 9534, 1066, 1567, 18677, 1610, 3677, 1080, 8018, 1065, 5693, 1171, 4117, 1065, 1040, 22688, 1072, 9217, 8975, 29481, 1968, 1458, 1321, 1518, 7079, 2624, 4835, 1254, 1040, 4360, 9622, 1502, 12872, 1610, 3761, 1968, 8727, 1245, 1040, 10213, 5547, 1065, 1040, 22688, 8975, 15686, 1137, 1040, 6382, 1070, 10213, 6524, 29488, 5128, 1122, 4360, 9622, 1502, 1427, 1347, 2850, 1518, 7768, 1589, 4117, 1610, 12070, 1968, 2163, 10213, 4388, 2351, 1137, 1422, 29098, 3538, 1137, 20698, 6524, 29488, 6476, 1254, 10213, 6211, 2603, 1040, 10833, 1070, 1032, 12872, 1065, 1040, 10213, 5547, 2447, 1647, 1450, 3607, 2830, 1589, 2706, 4222, 12872, 29501, 1655, 3848, 16540, 1968, 1163, 1040, 5776, 2800, 6464, 10610, 4292, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 1155, 29502, 29491, 29550, 29520], 'total_duration': 2493986300, 'load_duration': 1067200, 'prompt_eval_count': 342, 'prompt_eval_duration': 968190000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1519033000}"
12,". Retailers ' inventories are generally being held down , and holiday season buildups are apparently lower than usual . Residential construction is reported to be improved in the St. Louis , Minneapolis , and Kansas City Districts . In the latter case , the improvement follows a prolonged strike in several of the building trades . Residential building continues weak , however , in the Boston , Richmond , Atlanta , and San Francisco Districts . While the liquidity positions of financial institutions are reported to have improved , the consensus of the reports is that loan demand remains weak . In some Districts this is reported to have led to greater investment in municipal securities by banks , and there is some speculation about the possibility of an imminent cut in the prime rate . Some moderation in the growth of prices is mentioned in the Richmond , Chicago , Dallas , and San Francisco reports . In some areas , consumers are continuing to shift to lower-to-medium priced goods , and price shading of consumer items is reported . Concern continues to be voiced , however , about the problem of controlling inflation in view of recent labor settlements which have resulted in large wage increases , for example , in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts . Increases in gas and electric utility rates and in prices of public services are of concern in the Atlanta District .

Most directors and other business leaders were less than enthusiastic over the use of wage and price controls . However , several were relatively open minded toward this approach , while many of the respondents felt additional action on the part of the Administration to limit further wage and price increases was needed . The Chairman of the electrical equipment manufacturer reported that the Business Council , which he headed until recently , had made it clear to President Nixon that Council Members do n't want wage and price controls because they are convinced they will never work . One director , however , commented that the time was approaching when wage and price controls must be adopted , and another director felt that , while controls would not be workable over any extended period , such controls might have a useful psychological effect for a short period . A partner in large investment banking firm noted that incomes policies have failed all over the world where they have been tried , but felt it was up to the United States to seek to find a solution to the problem of full employment without inflation .

According to newspaper reports , a steady stream of price increases continues and consumer loan rates have not been lowered in East Tennessee or Florida . Surveys conducted by directors of the Nashville Branch indicate adamant opposition to any type of incomes policy . The Jacksonville Branch Directors , on the other hand , expect some version of an incomes policy , with businessmen preferring guidelines to rigid controls . On December 28 , seven department store executives in Atlanta , Jacksonville , Birmingham , New Orleans , and Nashville were surveyed . The highest estimated year-to-year gain in December sales was 4.5 per cent . Most of the respondents reported a 1- to 2-per cent gain , though a store in Birmingham indicated that it experienced a 10 per cent decline . However , this was largely attributed to a construction strike that has now been settled . All respondents indicated that consumers continued to practice `` buying down , '' that is . purchasing less expensive lines of merchandise . As might be expected , sales of '' high-ticket ' items , particularly TV 's , were very slow .

A Research Department telephone survey of department stores indicates that Easter sales were better than expected in New Orleans , Jacksonville , and Nashville . One leading store reported a year-to-year 15 percent gain in sales in the January through mid- April period . Sales have been weak in Birmingham , perhaps because of the threat of a steel strike . The Atlanta sales picture was mixed , with one respondent reporting sales stronger than expected but the other reporting sales about as expected . The survey detected a noticeable increase in optimism among retailers , and most of the respondents thought that the consumers had `` loosened up '' and begun to spend . There are some notable exceptions to generally more prosperous conditions in the District . The mobile-home industry continues to be in a slump , although some pickup has been reported in recent weeks . Several mobile-home plants are reported to have closed in south Georgia , and one Alabama producer has filed for bankruptcy .

The one exception to this general experience is in boating , where dealers are expecting a tremendous boat year in 1972 and are ordering accordingly . These orders are , however , based on expectations , not actual sales experience . Capital goods producers described business as sluggish in all lines except office and public construction . In some cases directors noted a recent deterioration in orders . One director said that he had just become aware that in the container machinery field , customers were cutting back their capital budgets . Another director felt that the recent downturn in capital goods orders was a result of uncertainties about investment tax credit . Sales of intermediate products to the industrial sector were variously described as sluggish to poor , especially among suppliers to the aerospace and chemical industries . Only one director mentioned that one of his plants was continuing to decrease employment .

One director noted less foreign competition in the construction material market , in part due to the surcharge , in part to a new buy-American feeling inspired by the President",0.3,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:42:52.0271135Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 29527, 4976, 29473, 29508, 29502, 1968, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29508, 4257, 23418, 12402, 1137, 1420, 12845, 2723, 1117, 16085, 1066, 5684, 12091, 2767, 1968, 1072, 1065, 1032, 2432, 5483, 24734, 1114, 1968, 2080, 1420, 6333, 12050, 2723, 1117, 2077, 4216, 1903, 23833, 1557, 1610, 4403, 1070, 1581, 23418, 9072, 5105, 26679, 1651, 9274, 1245, 1420, 25063, 1610, 8172, 3848, 1245, 1040, 7060, 9789, 1070, 1581, 23418, 1232, 19021, 12845, 10749, 1117, 12091, 2767, 2641, 1968, 1330, 1504, 1117, 1476, 6334, 1070, 1032, 10505, 1436, 1456, 1610, 1183, 1392, 6619, 1066, 1224, 3720, 3427, 1117, 1065, 2127, 1845, 1968, 1738, 3983, 1172, 1228, 16318, 1032, 24711, 9856, 1647, 1065, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29518, 1072, 1228, 20583, 26253, 1610, 3725, 9404, 1228, 1968, 4313, 1968, 3586, 1124, 14647, 1968, 1227, 5463, 7060, 3427, 1610, 17821, 12050, 23630, 6165, 2723, 1158, 1903, 23833, 1557, 1065, 1312, 5483, 4509, 4775, 1072, 1566, 7148, 1610, 1328, 1509, 5237, 23418, 9427, 1032, 6159, 19979, 2550, 1120, 1065, 9404, 1610, 3155, 7627, 1541, 1137, 1168, 1321, 1544, 3495, 6403, 1137, 1065, 1040, 8408, 27282, 2602, 1968, 6456, 1422, 12932, 1620, 1420, 6333, 9094, 29481, 1610, 7648, 7627, 3538, 1137, 1040, 6159, 15897, 1221, 1065, 6333, 12050, 9404, 1171, 1032, 1972, 1070, 1289, 9190, 2458, 1265, 1452, 9310, 4715, 6951, 1610, 17145, 1070, 23370, 4844, 1066, 1040, 11431, 10410, 1422, 4886, 1114, 6165, 1158, 1903, 23833, 1557, 1066, 6134, 1968, 4780, 4120, 25063, 1066, 1040, 1032, 11435, 3412, 1072, 11613, 18677, 1610, 7120, 1392, 7627, 7851, 1137, 1392, 1070, 1284, 10691, 1171, 16085, 1066, 18657, 14855, 1610, 781, 781, 6935, 7627, 9427, 2876, 7991, 9763, 1065, 1040, 7148, 4156, 3436, 1968, 1065, 1512, 3708, 1066, 1040, 1915, 15746, 1968, 1065, 1512, 1066, 1032, 1401, 4616, 29501, 12956, 5390, 12739, 1254, 1040, 5888, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29538, 29520], 'total_duration': 2629282600, 'load_duration': 6006800, 'prompt_eval_count': 349, 'prompt_eval_duration': 982889000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1641598000}"

Until the Phase II program was made public , about one-fourth of the directors were expecting substantial increases in prices , half were anticipating moderate increases , and the rest were looking for little change . Thus , the consensus of directors , by a small majority , is that the creation of the Pay and Price Boards enhances the prospect for greater price stability . The outlook for the regional economy was also largely unchanged by announcement of the Phase II outline . Eighteen of the directors currently foresee a moderate increase in activity in their local areas , as compared with 14 earlier . The announcement caused no alteration in the directors ' assessment of the prospects for the unemployment rate in their local areas .

Since retail sales are so important at this time of year and consumer spending is being closely watched as a clue to economic growth in 1971 , district retail stores were again surveyed this month . Reports were mixed—with some department stores and discount houses reporting a decline in sales during December , as compared with the same month last year ; while others reported gains , mostly of a modest nature . After having generally good sales in November , several stores reported that sales in early December were disappointing but then improved substantially again just before Christmas . Weather conditions may have been partly responsible for this pattern . Generally , stores that had the best gains were the large combination mail order-department stores . One regional controller of a chain of such stores said that their sales usually hold up quite well during economic slowdowns when customers are interested in good quality at reasonable prices . Somewhat surprisingly , a large store that specializes in luxury gift items and caters to above-average income customers reported sales this fall increased by about 10 per cent . Generally , stores that had strong sales just before Christmas also report strong post-Christmas sales , while stores with weak pre-Christmas sales continue to exhibit weak sales .

The surveyed retail stores were also asked whether they had used any extra promotional activities such as intensified advertising campaigns or earlier price reductions this year due to the economic slowdown",0.3,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:43:03.1067249Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 1084, 1508, 1491, 11948, 1254, 1959, 12325, 1234, 1070, 10482, 5041, 1044, 2730, 26364, 1610, 5345, 12371, 7060, 1228, 1347, 3046, 1206, 1224, 1495, 1070, 1647, 1072, 12845, 10749, 1117, 2018, 12408, 7526, 1158, 1032, 25281, 1066, 7406, 6825, 1065, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29508, 1968, 7949, 12371, 11626, 1422, 1844, 11679, 1054, 1224, 2870, 1610, 2066, 3497, 1422, 10198, 29589, 4183, 1509, 10552, 11626, 1072, 13479, 10394, 15206, 1032, 18236, 1065, 7060, 2706, 5693, 1968, 1158, 7499, 1163, 1040, 2116, 2870, 2200, 1647, 3521, 2080, 3431, 6513, 22490, 1968, 8212, 1070, 1032, 24444, 5503, 1610, 3298, 3229, 7509, 1947, 7060, 1065, 5117, 1968, 3624, 11626, 6513, 1137, 7060, 1065, 3703, 5693, 1422, 11502, 1056, 1330, 1636, 12725, 11651, 2697, 1844, 1544, 1927, 8184, 1610, 1584, 1991, 5099, 1761, 1274, 1518, 19976, 8100, 1122, 1224, 6108, 1610, 3534, 1346, 1968, 11626, 1137, 1321, 1040, 2257, 22490, 1422, 1040, 3243, 10238, 10404, 2513, 29501, 1218, 2500, 1234, 11626, 1610, 3155, 12676, 12560, 1070, 1032, 8418, 1070, 2027, 11626, 1541, 1137, 1420, 7060, 5080, 3168, 1350, 4216, 1930, 2706, 7406, 4712, 4022, 29481, 1507, 6456, 1228, 7116, 1065, 1947, 4813, 1206, 12069, 9274, 1610, 3677, 7570, 23875, 1968, 1032, 3243, 4911, 1137, 3609, 5772, 1065, 17979, 8643, 5675, 1072, 6023, 1172, 1066, 3515, 29501, 29476, 4832, 8672, 6456, 6513, 7060, 1224, 3717, 8251, 1254, 1452, 29473, 29508, 29502, 1428, 2363, 1610, 3534, 1346, 1968, 11626, 1137, 1321, 3735, 7060, 1544, 1927, 8184, 1603, 3032, 3735, 2472, 29501, 18469, 5644, 7060, 1968, 2080, 11626, 1163, 7102, 1478, 29501, 18469, 5644, 7060, 4456, 1066, 23388, 7102, 7060, 1610, 781, 781, 1782, 11679, 1054, 12371, 11626, 1422, 1603, 3029, 3929, 1358, 1321, 2075, 1475, 4978, 18790, 2247, 7058, 2027, 1158, 17466, 2567, 13664, 20654, 1210, 6353, 4912, 3998, 2076, 1224, 1647, 3708, 1066, 1040, 7406, 4712, 4022, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29538, 29520], 'total_duration': 2827715200, 'load_duration': 3386300, 'prompt_eval_count': 355, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1018608000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1807502000}"

Retailers are still looking forward to a good Christmas season , and District retail sales during Thanksgiving week were very encouraging . In addition , a recent newspaper poll revealed some improvement in consumer buying intentions for next year . Except for some increase in farm machinery sales , prospects of a 7 per cent tax credit have not yet affected District investment spending . According to reports received from Bank directors , uncertainty over Phase II has not affected the pace of economic activity in the Ninth District . One director stated that businessmen in his area were going ahead with their plans despite any uncertainty over Phase II . Another director considered Phase II a topic of conversation , but felt that it has not altered business decisions . One report , however , indicated that small businesses had held down , or delayed , raises due to difficulty in interpreting Phase II guidelines . The only adverse impact of Phase II reported by another director was that the time spent by businessmen in interpreting Phase II rules had kept managers away from more productive endeavors .

The directors also felt that the implementation of Phase II has not adversely influenced consumer sentiment in the District , and they reported that District retailers expect their sales to improve .

In contrast to the generally weak business loan demand in other parts of the country , the demand for business loans in the ninth district appears to be quite strong . Conversations with three reserve city bankers revealed that the rise in their business loans is stronger than they had anticipated , and some of these people felt that the recent cuts in the prime rate were unjustified , at least for their banks . One Director , who is also the president of a reserve city bank , said that although he keeps expecting his bank 's outstanding loan balances to fall , they keep rising to new highs . He feels that a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that his national customers have tended to ignore the corporate bond market as a source of debt funds and instead are relying on banks for their borrowings . Three other Directors from rural areas in the district also felt that loan demand was picking up . Although they were not sure of the reasons for the strengthening , they were able to cite instances pointing to a rise in loan demand . One South Dakota Director said , for example , that a number of banks in his area had dropped out of participation pools because they were able to use all their loanable funds for local borrowers .

25,"in the former case , the increase is a recovery from the strike- induced slump . The lack of strong demand is reflected in automobile production . General Motors has reduced overtime schedules and the other automobile producers are operating at reduced levels . Manufacturing shows no sign of a general recovery . There are industries which report a rise in output ( containers , furniture , steel , some machine tools , and textiles ) , but other industries are still retrenching . Although major layoffs of workers are occurring less often , companies are continuing to reduce their workforces through attrition or unpaid holidays . Increased hiring is still not widespread . Investment plans similarly are restrained and expenditures on capital equipment in 1971 are expected to be at about the same level as last year . Even rising new orders for steel are not a reflection of an upturn in the economy but rather represent hedging against either a steel strike or further price rises . According to steel industry economists , overall production for this year will not be above last year . There is one sector which has favorable prospects for recovery . The demand for residential housing is picking up and sales of existing houses are increasing . Nonresidential construction is not as strong at the moment , and in many areas it is quite weak .

Higher priced items such as color TV sets and high quality clothing continue to move slowly . Retailers report that inventories of most goods remain at very conservative levels , indicating considerable doubt that the recent upturn in sales will continue . Manufacturers are cautiously optimistic compared with the fact that no change was foreseen a month ago . The Cleveland Bank reports that new steel orders have increased sharply since mid-December . Furthermore , steel industry economists expect a big pickup in steel shipments to begin about March and the second quarter to be much stronger than the first . Much of this anticipated gain is based on rising demand in preparation for a steel strike . The Richmond Bank reported an increase in manufacturers ' inventories . With the exception of the steel companies , however , manufacturers generally do not indicate great gains in sales expectations . In conformity with this view , some layoffs and plant closings have recently occurred in the electronics and TV industries . Most Reserve banks indicate that the current high rate of unemployment is likely to continue for several months . Further declines in employment , however , are not expected as most reports indicate that the retrenchment process of firms is about complete .

Any future increases in the unemployment rate will primarily reflect additions to the labor force rather than layoffs .

28,"August 18 , 1971 The pessimism regarding the economic outlook that had been expressed by the directors of the New York Bank and of the Buffalo Branch last month was still evident , and perhaps intensified , this month ( before the Administration announced its new measures ) . In general , the assessment was for no significant change in consumer attitudes , while some directors believed there had been an actual scaling back of buying intentions ; business inventory spending was not expected to strengthen in the near future ; no noticeable improvement in labor market conditions was foreseen and most of the directors felt that a general economic upturn would gain momentum later than had been generally expected . Concerning consumer spending , the Buffalo Branch directors viewed retail sales activity as relatively better than a year ago , but with no discernible trend either up or down . The New York Branch directors were somewhat more pessimistic . A director from Rochester had had recent discussions with a cross section of New York City department store executives , who reported a slowdown in consumer spending in recent weeks and were generally pessimistic regarding the immediate future . The chairman of the board of a nationwide manufacturing concern believed that consumers were exhibiting caution and more selectivity regarding both price and quality , and saw consumer reluctance showing up particularly in discretionary spending , such as that for travel .

Other directors also thought there had been a scaling back in consumer buying plans",-0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:43:21.1517698Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 22343, 1237, 29473, 29508, 29551, 1968, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29508, 1183, 1052, 1177, 1089, 2211, 8985, 1040, 7406, 1343, 6587, 1137, 1321, 1518, 12326, 1254, 1040, 23418, 1070, 1040, 2218, 3494, 8606, 1072, 1070, 1040, 28868, 27270, 2200, 2870, 1171, 2077, 15653, 1968, 1072, 5998, 17466, 2567, 1968, 1224, 2870, 1093, 1927, 1040, 17954, 7772, 1639, 1401, 11350, 1911, 1610, 1328, 3720, 1968, 1040, 15849, 1171, 1122, 1476, 6632, 3036, 1065, 12845, 27812, 1968, 2080, 1509, 23418, 8529, 1504, 1321, 1518, 1164, 5463, 20671, 1620, 1070, 10505, 25855, 3521, 2723, 20698, 10749, 1171, 1227, 4117, 1066, 16742, 1065, 1040, 3833, 4205, 3521, 1476, 6408, 1290, 14972, 1065, 8347, 3436, 5099, 1171, 3185, 18994, 1072, 1848, 1070, 1040, 23418, 3538, 1137, 1032, 3720, 7406, 1100, 1215, 1221, 1450, 9124, 14787, 2830, 1589, 1321, 1518, 7509, 4117, 1610, 2093, 3510, 1739, 12845, 10749, 1968, 1040, 28868, 27270, 23418, 17629, 12371, 7060, 7123, 1158, 10870, 2641, 1589, 1032, 1647, 4352, 1968, 1330, 1163, 1476, 3080, 1941, 1838, 9924, 3245, 1350, 1210, 1828, 1610, 1183, 2218, 3494, 27270, 23418, 1422, 11731, 1448, 1052, 1177, 1089, 4088, 1610, 1098, 7627, 1245, 27098, 3174, 1321, 1321, 6159, 19150, 1163, 1032, 4661, 4979, 1070, 2218, 3494, 4573, 10552, 4911, 5314, 2539, 1968, 1461, 6513, 1032, 4712, 4022, 1065, 12845, 10749, 1065, 6159, 5355, 1072, 1422, 7509, 1052, 1177, 1089, 4088, 8985, 1040, 12167, 4205, 1610, 1183, 22340, 1070, 1040, 5881, 1070, 1032, 6646, 6502, 15954, 5136, 8529, 1137, 14544, 1422, 9012, 5096, 27537, 1072, 1448, 6107, 3342, 8985, 2328, 4912, 1072, 4813, 1968, 1072, 3440, 12845, 20006, 1385, 8870, 1350, 7079, 1065, 23451, 1064, 1396, 10749, 1968, 2027, 1158, 1137, 1122, 5298, 1610, 781, 781, 16449, 23418, 1603, 2422, 1504, 1321, 1518, 1032, 20671, 1620, 1065, 12845, 10505, 7168, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 1155, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 2585168300, 'load_duration': 638300, 'prompt_eval_count': 346, 'prompt_eval_duration': 968704000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1608047000}"
29,"July 21 , 1971 The opinions expressed recently by Second District Federal Reserve Bank directors seemed to reflect some renewed doubts regarding the strength of the economic recovery . The directors in general foresaw no near-term improvement in the unemployment picture—indeed a few expected further weakening—and some felt that additional disruptive strikes were in the offing . On the other hand , the outlook for consumer spending and residential construction remains good ; no significant changes in the trends in these sectors were thought to have occurred in the recent past . Most of the directors felt that a widespread lack of confidence among both businessmen and consumers is a major factor in the disappointingly slow rate of economic recovery . Concerning the unemployment situation , the directors felt the continuing efforts of businessmen to cut back costs made it unlikely that a significant reduction of unemployment would be achieved in the coming months . The chairman of the board of a large New York City bank said he expected that his firm would have a smaller staff at the end of 1971 than it had earlier in the year , and felt that other financial institutions-the city 's strongest employers—also would not contribute much support for the local job market this year . The president of a nationwide manufacturer of plumbing and related products felt that the wage-cost squeeze was forcing industry to cut back on spending and employment .

The Buffalo Branch directors agreed that labor markets in their locality generally continue to experience",-0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:43:23.8672696Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 29566, 3857, 29473, 29518, 29508, 1968, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29508, 1183, 15796, 12326, 6683, 1254, 7820, 8975, 12420, 23017, 8606, 23418, 4361, 1066, 8735, 1509, 14061, 1054, 29455, 8985, 1040, 7110, 1070, 1040, 7406, 12874, 1610, 1183, 23418, 1065, 3720, 1053, 4394, 1835, 1476, 3833, 29501, 7358, 14972, 1065, 1040, 29402, 6522, 29589, 9123, 1054, 1032, 2432, 4117, 4397, 1246, 3357, 1056, 29589, 1159, 1509, 3538, 1137, 5638, 29447, 1263, 24896, 1422, 1065, 1040, 1573, 1056, 1610, 2186, 1040, 1567, 1789, 1968, 1040, 1343, 6587, 1122, 12845, 10749, 1072, 19118, 7148, 8288, 1947, 3521, 1476, 6632, 5203, 1065, 1040, 18637, 1065, 1935, 23782, 1422, 2422, 1066, 1274, 10662, 1065, 1040, 6159, 3377, 1610, 5590, 1070, 1040, 23418, 3538, 1137, 1032, 24491, 6270, 1070, 10611, 4120, 2328, 2723, 2897, 1072, 14544, 1117, 1032, 3782, 7767, 1065, 1040, 11502, 8149, 4712, 5106, 1070, 7406, 12874, 1610, 2093, 3510, 1739, 1040, 29402, 5388, 1968, 1040, 23418, 3538, 1040, 16085, 9048, 1070, 2723, 2897, 1066, 3887, 1620, 7734, 2037, 1146, 16532, 1137, 1032, 6632, 14156, 1070, 29402, 1450, 1115, 12779, 1065, 1040, 4292, 4138, 1610, 1183, 22340, 1070, 1040, 5881, 1070, 1032, 3243, 2218, 3494, 4573, 5974, 1541, 1168, 4117, 1137, 1284, 6567, 1450, 1274, 1032, 7768, 5852, 1206, 1040, 1716, 1070, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29508, 1589, 1146, 1321, 6353, 1065, 1040, 1647, 1968, 1072, 3538, 1137, 1567, 6361, 13406, 29501, 2005, 3758, 1232, 29481, 28454, 23039, 29589, 18801, 1450, 1227, 15719, 1956, 2528, 1122, 1040, 2630, 3157, 3436, 1224, 1647, 1610, 1183, 5719, 1070, 1032, 6646, 6502, 18514, 1070, 1317, 27778, 1072, 5970, 4844, 3538, 1137, 1040, 21830, 29501, 14942, 12090, 20729, 1171, 21272, 5547, 1066, 3887, 1620, 1124, 10749, 1072, 14855, 1610, 781, 781, 1782, 28868, 27270, 23418, 6593, 1137, 8347, 12342, 1065, 1420, 2630, 1240, 7509, 4456, 1066, 3427, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 1155, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 2711207900, 'load_duration': 7541800, 'prompt_eval_count': 353, 'prompt_eval_duration': 979913000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1725349000}"
30,"April 6 , 1971 The opinions expressed by the Directors of this Bank and the Buffalo branch and other business leaders in general continued to point to an uncertain economic outlook . On balance , the assessment was : a still cautious consumer attitude ; a somewhat less optimistic residential construction picture ; little or no improvement in the unemployment situation ; and relatively uninspiring prospects for 1971 corporate profits . Sentiments were mixed with respect to the likely volume of further corporate borrowing in the bond market . In view of most of the Directors and of the retailers that were contacted , the long awaited rebound in consumer spending has not as yet materialized . Indeed , it was generally believed that no real pickup in consumer spending could be expected as long as consumer confidence continued to be adversely affected by the unemployment situation . Several of the respondents , however , felt that given the current high rates of individual savings , a change in consumer mood could well trigger a sharp increase in such outlays . With respect to residential housing construction the picture painted by the respondents was somewhat less rosy than it had been in earlier months . To be sure , the consensus was that there still remained a shortage of housing for lower and middle income families , and that mortgage money had become more readily available at lower rates . On the other hand , it was felt that to a large extent the demand for",-0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:43:33.5834456Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.6}\n\n   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t', 'done': False}"
31,"December 8 , 1971 Results of our regular survey of businessmen and bankers in the Fifth District indicate that the moderate expansion in business activity evident in the last several months is still under way . Manufacturers report increases in shipments , new orders and backlogs of orders , and retail sales continue relatively strong . Construction activity is not as vigorous as it has been in recent months , with some slackening in residential construction being especially evident . Loan demand continues to follow the pattern set in recent months , with consumer loan demand especially strong . In general , District manufacturers report that shipments , new orders , and backlogs of orders are up over the previous reporting period . Increases are reported in such industries as furniture , textiles , chemicals , and electrical equipment , while decreases are reported by hosiery , apparel , and synthetic fiber producers . Manufacturers ' inventories were reported to have increased slightly for the first time in several months and the level of inventories , relative to desired levels , showed some improvement over last month . Although the long coal strike dampened business activity in some areas , on balance District bankers and businessmen in trade and services report that retail , sales are up in their areas .

38,"October 11 , 1972 Indicators of economic activity in the Eleventh District were mixed in August . Although the Texas Industrial Production Index eased slightly from its revised record level in July , the unemployment rate for the five District states declined , and employment continued to increase . Department store sales in the District also continued strong , and construction activity rebounded sharply . However , the rate of new car registrations declined slightly . A decrease in the production of nonmanufactured goods was primarily responsible for the slight decline in the seasonally adjusted Texas Industrial Production Index in August . The decline was centered in public utilities and crude oil mining . Nevertheless , production in both these industries was well above its level of a year ago . The Index for manufacturing industries remained essentially unchanged . Seasonally adjusted total nonagricultural employment in the five Southwestern states rose to a record level in August and helped to push the unemployment rate down slightly . Both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing employment increased , with employment in durable goods manufacturing and mining showing particularly notable gains . Government employment and employment in service industries also increased in August . Slight employment declines were reported in construction and transportation and public utilities . However , all industry groups posted year-to-year gains .

39,"February 9 , 1972 Phase II policies , and competitive market forces operating in an economy performing well below its potential , are apparently combining to moderate the pace of rising prices . A survey of purchasing agents and managers in the Tenth District indicates that they perceive ( 1 ) a somewhat slower rate of price rise for materials they purchase , ( 2 ) generally good compliance by vendors with Phase II guidelines , and ( 3 ) the existence of market forces also acting to restrain price increases . Inventory policy is quite conservative , with little buildup of stocks now anticipated , almost regardless of industry . Among District banks , consumer installment lending and agricultural loan demand remain strong , while local business loan demand has shown little change in recent weeks from its basically weak position . The view from the desks of purchasing managers in the Tenth District seems to be favorable to Phase II , with overall understanding and compliance felt to be generally good . Specific comments suggest that , as far as purchasing agents are concerned , vendors generally appear to be following the Phase II guidelines . Purchasing agents for a number of firms regularly review suppliers ' prices for compliance , some require invoices to be stamped as in accordance with Price Commission rulings , and others report that notices of price rises are accompanied with word that they have been cleared with the Price Commission .

40,"August 9 , 1972 The vigor in the economic recovery reflected nationally in the most recent GNP figures appears to be mirrored in the sales reports of a number of Tenth District manufacturing firms as well as in comments elicited from bank directors . Increased sales were reported quite generally , and although little evidence of stockpiling is evident , inventory spending is keeping pace with recent sales improvements . Some firms reported longer delivery times to their customers , and there were scattered reports of lengthening lead times for inventory purchases from their suppliers . Despite sales increases , however , few of the firms contacted have added net to their work forces , and , as a consequence , there were a number of firms which reported noticeable productivity gains . Tenth District farm income rose more sharply than for the nation as a whole in the first six months of 1972 , and income prospects for all of 1972 appear to be quite strong vis-a-vis last year . Strong loan demand continues at Tenth District banks , and , with few exceptions , District banks have experienced large increases in total deposits . A near-consensus emerged as to improved business sales among those manufacturing firms and directors queried .

Some large firms say that they have not borrowed short-term and that they do not intend to do so for the remainder of the year , but these firms , by and large , are exceptions to the general trend . In the Northwest , encouraging crop prospects have led farmers to borrow for equipment replacement and expansion . In the Mountain States , a strong business expansion has created credit demands for financing motels , manufacturing plants , shopping centers , and resort-type homes . In Southern California , further business-loan expansion is expected because of inventory investment and the rapid growth of capital spending .

48,"wage increases for fear of bringing back Phase One-type controls . Professors Eckstein , Samuelson , and Shapiro were available for comment this month . All felt the major problem for the economy is to get Phase Three `` off the ground '' . Shapiro criticized the strange and contradictory statements about Phase Three which have been made by members of the Administration . He urges greater clarification . He cited the relatively flat yield curve as evidence that `` people with money do not have inflationary expectations '' . Due to a lot of bad luck ( weather conditions and blight ) and high income elasticity of the demand for meat , Samuelson doubts prices can be held to the stated goals . Specifically , the 5.5 percent wage standard is not possible to achieve , given the recent and likely future path of the cost of living . On the other hand , cost-push inflation is not something that the monetary authorities can or ought to do a lot about , according to Samuelson . Samuelson also felt it inadvisable to be committed to a dollar parity rate at the cost of tighter interest rates than would be justified on the grounds of domestic policy . While Shapiro would have preferred to have let the dollar float , he urged the United States to stand firm in not supporting the dollar , forcing other countries to take either goods or dollars .

A `` shakeout '' of weaker competitors in the motor home and other recreational fields is said to be near-at-hand . Such a shakeout has been in progress for the past year in modular home building , and plant shutdowns are still reported . The mortgage market has eased with rates in the Detroit area reduced from 9 to 8.5 percent in the past few weeks . The 8 percent usury ceiling in Illinois continues to limit new loans . Home sales in the Chicago area were off about 50 percent from last year in recent weeks . Nevertheless , a recent survey shows prices of existing homes in the Chicago area to average 10 percent above a year earlier , compared to an 8 percent rise in the previous 12 months . This Bank 's survey of farmland values shows an average increase of 17 percent from a year ago as of October 1 , and a rise of 8 percent in the third quarter . These are the largest increases in the 20 years of the survey . The soybean and corn harvests are coming along very well . Most areas report lower grain moisture content ( and better quality ) than last year , so less fuel will be needed for drying .

Those associated with capital goods and consumer goods areas mentioned that business has been extremely good , both they and their customers are having difficulty in building inventories . Several of the directors reported that they plan to keep a tight rein on their inventory situation , however . Some of the directors were of the opinion that part of the strength in new orders was the result of numerous capital goods customers placing advance orders because they fear shortages later this year . Concern was also expressed about the effect of recent price behavior on the large number of major labor negotiations scheduled through 1973 . Some of the directors are also becoming concerned about the prospects for a reduced pace of business activity in 1974 . One director whose diversified firm has record orders in all areas of its business , mentioned specifically that he expects a drop off in business next year and is therefore avoiding an overextension of plant capacity . Economists from major firms in the area are also reporting ebullient business conditions , and they are projecting a sustained high level of operations—at or near capacity—through 1973 .

53,"November 14 , 1973 Business activity in the District remains strong , although there are some signs of slowing . Apart from the weakening in housing and consumer durables , the slowing is probably more a reflection of capacity limitations and a tight supply situation in raw materials and fuels than the result of a decline in underlying demand . Our Directors and businessmen and economists in the District are gravely concerned over the energy situation and its implications for the economy in 1974 . Output in the District 's manufacturing sector continues to rise , but signs of slowing in the upward momentum are accumulating . Our monthly survey of manufacturers shows a significant decline in the proportion of firms reporting gains in new orders and backlogs in recent months . September was the poorest month of the year , and early returns for October suggest further weakening occurred . There has also been some slowdown in the rate of inventory accumulation . Delivery time , however , continues to lengthen , compounding the problem of shortages faced by virtually every firm . ( The October report of Cleveland purchasing agents questioned how there could be a recession next year in view of the fact that very little inventory is available and deliveries are taking three to six months or more on practically everything . ) There was a surge in price increases during October , as the largest proportion of firms in the ten-year history of our survey reported paying higher prices .

Dallas reports the unemployment rate dropping to 3.6 percent , while the First District is still experiencing unemployment rates above 6 percent . Philadelphia reports modest gains in employment , while Chicago , Cleveland , Dallas , Atlanta , and St. Louis have tight labor markets with significant skilled labor shortages . Growing raw material shortages and lengthening delivery times were also mentioned by most Banks . Shortages of petroleum products , wood products and nonferrous metals were cited by New York , while gasoline rationing was noted in parts of the Atlanta and Dallas districts .

The Dallas Bank reports that oil companies believe that rationing is a `` definite possibility '' and Chicago reports that fuel shortages in the Midwest are the `` worst in the world '' with oil firms refusing new customers and placing ceilings on sales .

The growing ramifications of the energy crisis , continued rapid price inflation in the face of cutbacks in output and employment , widespread shortages , and dissatisfaction with government at all levels have created an unprecedented atmosphere of uncertainty among consumers and businessmen . This mood has been deepened by the independent truckers ' strike which began at the end of January and is not yet fully resolved . Communities dependent on the manufacture of full-sized cars and recreational vehicles are economic disaster areas . In contrast , equipment producers generally are experiencing an unparalleled boom , with many firms unable to meet production schedules . While shortages of materials and components seem worse than ever , there are reports of firms doing precautionary advance buying ( hoarding ) of fuel and supplies of other scarce materials . Most businessmen , apparently , would favor the complete abandonment of price and wage controls . Although the independent truckers ' strike may be ending , the stoppages could be resumed at any time . Consumers and businessmen have an added incentive to add to inventories of required supplies . The strikes have curtailed output and caused layoffs principally in steel , motor vehicles , and meat and poultry processing .

Since late January , the Chicago area has witnessed long lines of cars at filling stations . Many stations have been closed and others have sharply reduced their hours of operation . Most smaller centers of the District , however , are reported to have plenty of gasoline . ( One reason suggested for the disparity is that Chicago area motorists are taking fewer trips out of town . ) Gas shortages have substantially reduced receipts at many restaurants and other establishments dependent on auto traffic . Insurance salesmen , and other businessmen dependent on mobility , also have been hurt . Perhaps those affected by fuel shortages can take comfort in the recent words of the District 's best know economist : `` I do n't believe the energy problem changes the economic outlook very much . '' In contrast to the gasoline and diesel fuel situations , heating oil problems seem to have faded away—even in Michigan where the problem had appeared most serious . Reductions in output of autos doubtless have released fuel for other uses . Some major District gas utilities have been telling interruptible customers to plan on switching to electricity or to other fuels . They see no possibility of substantially increasing gas supplies in the next several years .

74,"The firm does not plan to expand capacity , however , because they fear that the orders may be canceled . The same director noted that many businessmen are expecting wage-price controls and therefore are retrenching on their capital spending . Another director with a utility expressed deep concern that `` utilities are in a liquidity crisis , which may provoke an energy crisis . '' According to this director , electric utilities are canceling atomic plants because of their high capital costs , and substituting less capital intensive coal and oil plants . The irony is that atomic plants have fixed fuel costs , while coal and oil plants have rising fuel costs—so the shift away from atomic plants is inflationary in the long run . A second director confirmed this , noting that both atomic and fossil plants have been canceled because of the high cost of financing and load demand running below expectations . A number of these facilities were slated for completion after 1980 . In addition , because of rising construction costs , there is a rush to complete those plants currently under construction .

Some firms are coping with inflation by increasing the use of escalator clauses . Inflation is contributing to some hoarding and speculation in inventories . Recent strength in business loan demand largely reflects the need to finance higher-valued inventories and rising accounts receivable at a time when real cash flow is deteriorating .

A director from a large business machines firm , however , said that the raw materials situation is improving . Another director indicated that basic materials industries are going to expand capacity significantly ( until now , pollution control expenditures have absorbed a high percentage of their capital equipment spending . ) One director noted there is no longer an oversupply of large cars , in fact , it appears that the auto companies may have over-reacted in their shift to small car production .

76,"January 16 , 1974 Scarcity of pipe , rigs , and work crews continues to constrain petroleum drilling in the Southwest , according to an association of drillers , since many do not have permanent workers or established lines of supply . The association reports that the shortage of drilling rigs could be a problem for as long as three years because capacity constraints are limiting the ability of manufacturers to fill a growing backlog of orders . The seasonally adjusted index of industrial production in Texas fell in November for the first time since July 1973 . The decline was centered in mining of crude oil , petroleum refining , and production of petroleum-related chemicals . Despite intensified drilling , mining of crude oil has decreased because of the reduction of domestic reserves of crude . At the same time , shortages of crude oil have contributed to the reduction in refining activity , although in recent weeks imports have been greater than they were earlier anticipated to be . Unscheduled shutdowns for repairs and maintenance have also hampered refining . A survey of manufacturers based in Texas indicates that many firms are taking action to stockpile petroleum or petroleum-related products . While many businesses complained about more limited supplies and rising prices , there is no evidence that petroleum or related products are unobtainable .

Shortages were reported in plastics , solvents , and diesel fuel , but many manufacturers seemed just as concerned about the scarcity of nonpetroleum materials such as steel ,",-0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:46:19.0581117Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 22418, 4852, 29473, 29508, 29552, 1968, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29549, 3290, 7295, 1240, 1070, 14429, 1968, 11304, 29481, 1968, 1072, 1539, 2085, 7188, 11120, 1066, 8898, 1194, 6176, 10374, 1151, 2373, 9085, 1065, 1040, 4426, 8239, 1968, 5539, 1066, 1164, 14663, 1070, 2373, 1193, 1172, 1968, 2622, 2055, 1279, 1227, 1274, 13857, 8201, 1210, 7508, 5483, 1070, 8770, 1610, 1183, 14663, 8727, 1137, 1040, 3253, 1233, 1070, 2373, 9085, 11304, 29481, 1597, 1115, 1032, 3468, 1122, 1158, 1811, 1158, 2480, 2035, 1864, 9212, 15609, 1228, 28699, 1040, 6305, 1070, 20013, 1066, 5979, 1032, 7253, 1620, 2350, 1070, 9404, 1610, 1183, 4070, 1346, 22643, 3759, 1070, 11431, 5653, 1065, 8594, 6738, 1065, 5117, 1122, 1040, 1675, 1495, 2622, 5166, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29538, 1610, 1183, 18236, 1171, 26672, 1065, 15889, 1070, 6105, 1218, 6271, 1968, 6176, 10374, 1151, 2560, 4806, 1968, 1072, 5653, 1070, 6176, 10374, 1151, 29501, 10414, 25688, 1610, 10959, 17466, 2567, 2373, 9085, 1968, 15889, 1070, 6105, 1218, 6271, 1427, 9280, 2061, 1864, 1070, 1040, 14156, 1070, 13634, 27631, 1070, 6105, 1218, 1610, 2562, 1040, 2116, 1495, 1968, 3253, 2059, 1070, 6105, 1218, 6271, 1274, 19514, 1066, 1040, 14156, 1065, 2560, 4806, 7123, 1968, 6200, 1065, 6159, 5355, 29133, 1274, 1518, 7285, 1589, 1358, 1422, 6353, 25792, 1066, 1115, 1610, 1703, 29481, 24150, 7177, 4022, 29481, 1122, 25535, 1072, 13132, 1274, 1603, 11986, 1255, 1054, 2560, 4806, 1610, 1098, 11679, 1070, 20013, 3586, 1065, 8594, 13593, 1137, 2055, 19021, 1228, 4112, 3760, 1066, 6524, 29488, 1314, 6176, 10374, 1151, 1210, 6176, 10374, 1151, 29501, 10414, 4844, 1610, 4791, 2055, 9457, 25825, 1452, 1448, 7284, 14447, 1072, 12630, 9274, 1968, 1504, 1117, 1476, 6334, 1137, 6176, 10374, 1151, 1210, 5970, 4844, 1228, 1289, 1366, 12860, 1290, 1610, 781, 781, 13794, 2059, 1422, 6513, 1065, 1317, 1297, 1831, 1968, 2896, 29496, 1556, 1968, 1072, 5916, 1069, 11392, 1968, 1330, 2055, 20013, 4361, 1544, 1158, 9827, 1452, 1040, 29044, 1240, 1070, 2611, 6961, 10374, 1151, 7837, 2027, 1158, 10213, 1968, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 1155, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 2895668600, 'load_duration': 4959200, 'prompt_eval_count': 384, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1038961000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1847428000}"
77,"September 5 , 1974 An informal poll of director opinion reveals a considerable deterioration in expectations tied mainly to the slump in stock market prices . Concern over bank liquidity and credit quality is evident , but primary worries are on the status of the economy . Most directors believe the nation will be facing very difficult business conditions for at least the remainder of 1974 . However , most also believe we have no choice but to stay with a heavily restrictive monetary policy to dampen inflation . They believe that possible increased restraint in fiscal policy might permit some modest easing of credit restraint . Increased output of petrochemicals accounts for much of the continued growth in industrial production in the Eleventh District . Petroleum refining has grown steadily since March when foreign oil began flowing to Texas refineries . Crude runs to stills have now climbed well above the levels that prevailed prior to the Arab oil embargo , and expanded refinery output has increased feedstocks to chemical producers who are hard pressed to meet soaring demand . Industrial production has also been boosted by gains in textile output . Shortages of fibers have eased and have allowed textile producers to replace badly depleted inventories of finished goods . Paper producers , on the other hand , report the availability of wood pulp remains tight , but they have been able to increase output nonetheless .

This reluctance to pass lower meat animal prices on to the consumer has slowed the movement of meat through the marketing chain and has contributed to an oversupply of heavy animals . Consequently , the livestock industry continues in a depressed financial state . However , on the basis of a recent telephone survey to a limited number of commercial bankers , most cattle loans have been adequately secured during the past year , thereby minimizing the number of bad loans . It was reported that a few rural banks may be in jeopardy because of poor cattle paper . The District 's wheat situation has not improved since the last Red Book . Various reports indicate that drought has destroyed much of the crop in New Mexico and Colorado . Given the recent planting difficulties in the spring wheat regions , 1974 wheat production may fall short of official estimates . However , the crop is still expected to surpass last year 's record of 1.7 billion bushels . The volume of business loans declined substantially during May at weekly reporting banks , thereby providing some indication that business loan demand has perhaps begun to slow .

Industries closely related to housing and consumer durables ( lumber , glass , textiles , furniture , and appliances ) are noticeably weaker . In addition , several Districts ( New York , Chicago , Kansas City , and San Francisco ) report that some industrial materials , particularly fuels , certain chemicals , and paper , are more readily available . The easing of supply constraints in these industries is contributing to less aggressive purchasing and some declines in order backlogs . Cleveland , Chicago , Kansas City , and Dallas indicate somewhat softer prices for chemicals , fuels , and other materials , but no major break in industrial prices has occurred to date . Steel markets remain tight in most Districts , due in part to the prospective coal strike . Both Cleveland and San Francisco suggest an easing in the steel situation in coming months , however , due to the increased availability of foreign steel . The agricultural outlook appears generally weaker . Atlanta reports favorable harvest yields with the exception of the hurricane-damaged Louisiana sugar cane crop . But Chicago , St. Louis , Minneapolis , and Kansas City indicate that early frosts will substantially reduce corn and soybean yields , reducing farm incomes and increasing feed costs .

The respondents generally expected further significant price increases . Consumer outlays remained relatively strong in the New York City area , but some weakening was noted upstate . Construction is expected to be further adversely affected by the rise in short-term interest rates and the resulting outflow of funds from thrift institutions . Views regarding the prospective demand for short-term business credit were mixed but on balance pointed to a sustained strong demand . The directors in general agreed that the slackening in business activity which has occurred in recent months is likely to be followed by an improvement as the year wears on . The president of a large chemical corporation thus characterized the slack in the economy as minor , and the president of a large nationwide retail concern looked for some improvement in the second half of the year .

A related factor is the increasing number of yarn varieties , which creates a difficult inventory problem for textile raw materials manufacturers in view of more volatile shifts in demand for particular finished goods styles . Retail inventory levels are well-balanced on the whole , although some remaining excess is reported in expensive furniture lines and to a lesser degree in appliances and other big-ticket items .

He fears that though things look rather hopeful on first blush , the economy has no holding power—the financial condition of business especially is unfavorable and we risk stagnation if the rebound is not nurtured .

We need not lock the throttle at higher rates of money expansion ; we need to assist the recovery .

He is sympathetic with the use of the federal funds rate as a target and he is relieved to see that it has eased somewhat . He notes that a 5 percent funds rate accompanies 8.3 percent money growth in his model—this is close enough to 7.5 percent to be well within our margins of forecasting and control errors . Five percent money growth would produce a depression and would be plausible only if inflation falls to the 1 to 2 percent level . Samuelson senses that the trough is near .

Today , foreign mills , particularly Japanese producers , are undercutting domestic steel prices by 20 to 25 percent . The sluggish pace of construction activity has led to extremely aggressive bidding by manufacturers of building materials for new projects . A Fort Worth manufacturer of reinforcing steel bars said mills are engaged in the most aggressive price-cutting that he has seen in 25 years in the industry . Many jobs are actually being bid below cost as mills try to keep their share of the market and attempt to hold on to the backbone of their work force . A survey of independent oil producers reveals a consensus of opinion that the proposed energy legislation before Congress would be a disaster if enacted . The respondents feel changes are due but not in the direction of those proposed . Not only would changes now being considered roll back crude oil prices from an average of $ 8.75 per barrel to $ 7.66 , but legislation would tighten the rules expensing intangible drilling costs . The latter change would reduce funds available for drilling and impact most severely on small independents , who account for much exploratory drilling .

One positive sign has been a sharp decrease in the number of applications for debt consolidation loans this year . Credit card usage is on the rise , and suburban bankers note that automobile loans have picked up . In addition , there are numerous reports of banks offering comprehensive service packages in attempts to rekindle consumer borrowing . Good harvests , increased marketings of cattle , and higher average prices since midyear have bolstered crop and livestock sales in the Eleventh District . Consequently , cash flows to farmers and ranches have improved , and rural bankers report the rate of loan repayment has increased while the number of renewals and extensions has declined . Although flush with funds , agribankers continue to be very cautious in granting credit . Uncertainty over markets and weather and the carryover effects of depressed incomes in 1974 , particularly among cattle feeders , serve to keep collateral requirements firm . Nevertheless , agricultural lending this fall is above year-earlier levels . Rising production costs and slightly more acreage in cultivation have increased the farmer 's demand for bank credit .

103,"a year ago . The second-quarter pickup in homebuilding was not sustained in the third quarter . Housing unit authorizations in July-August only matched second-quarter levels . Recent figures , though improved from the beginning of this year , were well below the numbers issued in the early 1970s . Also , district nonresidential building spending remained down from a year ago . Savings deposit growth at district commercial banks and savings and loan associations slowed somewhat in the third quarter , following rapid growth during the first half of 1975 . The slowdown largely reflected the growing attractiveness of U.S. Government Securities , whose yields have risen above the highest rates that savings institutions are permitted to pay . Mortgage loans closed and mortgage loan commitments by district S & Ls continued to climb rapidly in the third quarter . However , if past relationships prevail , S & Ls will soon be scaling back the volume of new loan commitments to match the slower savings growth . Loan growth at district commercial banks strengthened substantially in September from the weak pattern that had existed during 1975 .",-0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:48:16.1847934Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 29476, 1647, 4352, 1610, 1183, 2444, 29501, 1132, 4904, 3856, 1483, 1065, 2379, 20173, 1171, 1227, 26627, 1065, 1040, 4776, 9017, 1610, 1150, 24059, 5796, 3995, 14577, 1065, 5166, 29501, 22343, 1237, 1633, 17701, 2444, 29501, 1132, 4904, 6925, 1610, 28495, 11157, 1968, 2838, 12725, 1245, 1040, 6166, 1070, 1224, 1647, 1968, 1422, 1930, 4392, 1040, 6319, 12561, 1065, 1040, 3703, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29502, 29481, 1610, 5608, 1968, 7949, 2611, 1179, 28125, 4435, 10749, 8336, 1828, 1245, 1032, 1647, 4352, 1610, 11978, 1510, 18203, 6825, 1206, 7949, 8148, 14051, 1072, 18433, 1072, 10744, 26731, 29404, 11731, 1065, 1040, 4776, 9017, 1968, 3064, 9189, 6825, 2706, 1040, 1675, 3563, 1070, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29550, 1610, 1183, 4712, 4022, 13050, 17990, 1040, 7253, 7610, 10760, 1070, 1268, 29491, 29503, 29491, 10482, 5322, 1092, 1986, 1968, 5404, 19702, 1274, 7367, 1037, 3515, 1040, 8649, 8746, 1137, 18433, 13406, 1228, 16231, 1066, 2904, 1610, 15557, 12100, 16324, 5819, 1072, 18990, 10744, 6221, 2107, 1254, 7949, 1086, 1335, 1161, 29481, 6085, 1066, 17944, 14867, 1065, 1040, 4776, 9017, 1610, 3761, 1968, 1281, 3377, 10159, 8945, 1382, 1968, 1086, 1335, 1161, 29481, 1390, 4171, 1115, 20671, 1620, 1040, 8299, 1070, 1401, 10744, 6221, 2107, 1066, 3686, 1040, 26410, 18433, 6825, 1610, 8068, 1044, 6825, 1206, 7949, 8148, 14051, 16742, 1054, 11651, 2697, 1065, 4842, 1245, 1040, 7102, 6108, 1137, 1321, 17715, 2706, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29550, 1610, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 1155, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 2531819500, 'load_duration': 5146200, 'prompt_eval_count': 288, 'prompt_eval_duration': 854460000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1676289000}"
104,"January 15 , 1975 District `` Red Book '' reports for mid-January generally reflect the accentuation in most parts of the country of the pronounced deterioration of the economy in the recent past suggested by nationwide economic indicators . Retail sales in most areas over the holiday season were only equal or barely above last year 's level in dollar terms and , given the sharp rise in retail prices over the past year , lower in volume . Moreover , this year 's level was achieved only by dint of heavy pre-Christmas aggressive promotion , special sales , and price cutting in addition to the usual early January clearance sales . Against this background , a number of respondents in various Districts regarded retail inventories to be relatively high to excessive in relation to current sale prospects , with increased reports of efforts to reduce positions , both at the retail and manufacturing level . Planned business plant and equipment outlays , apart from energy related industries , on balance appeared to be weaker than had been expected , and a number of Districts report cutbacks , or outright cancellations of planned projects . The private residential construction , and to a lesser extent commercial construction , picture remained bleak , although a reported moderate reversal in the outflow of deposits at thrift institutions gives hope that the eventual bottoming of the decline in that industry may be approaching .

The profit outlook is , therefore , much improved . Retailers note that , as a result of reduced manufacturers ' inventories , goods obtained at low prices for use during promotions are very scarce . In general , the best sales increases are reported by top-of-the-line department stores which suffered greater sales erosion a year ago .

A brighter note about construction activity concerns three new hotels oriented toward convention business which have recently been completed in Atlanta . A total of 2,850 rooms have been added to the city 's hotel accommodations , all of which are near the downtown area . The negative aspect of reduced construction employment is offset by increased services employment produced by the opening of the three hotels .

Many firms experienced losses as a result of the devaluation of the Mexican peso . Although forecasts of the rate of expansion are more subdued and cautious , there seems to be no expectation that a recession is imminent . In fact , more analysts now anticipate that the upswing will continue into 1978 . The recent slowdown suggests to them that satisfaction of various demands is being pushed into the future . Sales of heavy trucks and trailers are well above last year and further gains are expected for 1977 , but the size of the expected increase in sales has been reduced . Orders for large outdoor cranes and some other types of construction equipment have picked up recently from depressed levels . Orders for mining equipment are sharply lower than last year , but inquiries have been at a high rate .

116,"until nonresidential construction begins a comeback . But even stronger demand for construction materials may not help the steel industry because as much as three-fourths of the current production of some firms goes into oil field equipment manufacturing which is now beginning to soften . In addition , aluminum output continues at the low level established last summer . Domestic drilling activity has taken a turn for the worse . After reaching a 14-year high in late December , the total number of active rotary drilling rigs dropped 16 percent to a 17-month low in March . A seasonal decline in drilling is expected in the first quarter of each year ; but according to some industry spokesmen , the cutback was also in response to a rollback in the average price of domestic crude oil to $ 7.66 a barrel—down from the January high of $ 8.43 . Many drilling contractors expect the decline to slow and drilling to begin a seasonal upswing in the last half of the year . However , the future is clouded by proposed legislation that is unfavorable to the industry .

117,"quarter of 1975 . For the month ended January 15 , prices received by farmers dropped 0.5 percent following a modest increase in December . Given the evidence of increased cattle placements in feedlots during the fourth quarter , together with the beginning of an expansion in hog farrowings , meat supplies in 1976 promise to be large enough to offer some stability to retail prices—assuming that the farm-to-retail margins do not widen significantly . The winter wheat situation in the District is still hanging in the balance due to the lack of moisture . Several stories of farmers abandoning the crop , taking steps to prevent wind erosion where there is no wheat , and applying for disaster payments have been reported in the news media . However , a large crop is still possible if the weather cooperates over the next few months . And , if crop producers follow through with their intentions as reported in January , the production of most crops in 1976 will likely be large enough to restrain any sharp rise in prices . In fact , given the information on probable carry-over stocks next summer and fall , grain prices could slide rather significantly should 1976 production levels be of bumper proportions . Tenth District bankers contacted had mixed views of business loan strength . Four banks indicated January declines in business loans while three reported strong gains .

Shifting of national accounts was mentioned by several banks as a major reason for either increased or decreased loan",0.2,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:49:03.0439476Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.2}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 1132, 4904, 1070, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29550, 1610, 2031, 1040, 2870, 7822, 5392, 29473, 29508, 29550, 1968, 9274, 4642, 1254, 17898, 8447, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29550, 4921, 3064, 1032, 24444, 6015, 1065, 5693, 1610, 13396, 1040, 6334, 1070, 8251, 23905, 20995, 5253, 1065, 6343, 29482, 2417, 2706, 1040, 10804, 9017, 1968, 3321, 1163, 1040, 6166, 1070, 1164, 11888, 1065, 1063, 1244, 2850, 1439, 1510, 1968, 10996, 14447, 1065, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29552, 9849, 1066, 1115, 3243, 2834, 1066, 3173, 1509, 16905, 1066, 12371, 9274, 29589, 1257, 22310, 1137, 1040, 7122, 29501, 1300, 29501, 2209, 1382, 15771, 1894, 1279, 1227, 1043, 7435, 11885, 1610, 1183, 9307, 28903, 5388, 1065, 1040, 8975, 1117, 2077, 13213, 1065, 1040, 8641, 3708, 1066, 1040, 6270, 1070, 28992, 1610, 15991, 6747, 1070, 17898, 9709, 1056, 1040, 22716, 1968, 4112, 6712, 1066, 6065, 6303, 2002, 1153, 1064, 1738, 1504, 1117, 1476, 28903, 1968, 1072, 15661, 1122, 18041, 15691, 1274, 1518, 6513, 1065, 1040, 4999, 4845, 1610, 3761, 1968, 1032, 3243, 22716, 1117, 2077, 3340, 1281, 1040, 8854, 19236, 1770, 1522, 1040, 2447, 2432, 4138, 1610, 1783, 1968, 1281, 22716, 23630, 2140, 1827, 1163, 1420, 25855, 1158, 6513, 1065, 5392, 1968, 1040, 5653, 1070, 1848, 27920, 1065, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29552, 1390, 4685, 1115, 3243, 2834, 1066, 6902, 1194, 1475, 10995, 9186, 1065, 9274, 1610, 1328, 2407, 1968, 2846, 1040, 2639, 1124, 22892, 7864, 29501, 2251, 22549, 2447, 6329, 1072, 3717, 1968, 19431, 9274, 1597, 17281, 3978, 11885, 1791, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29552, 5653, 6925, 1115, 1070, 1055, 26857, 13455, 1362, 1610, 1088, 8784, 8975, 5974, 1172, 29098, 1321, 10198, 8812, 1070, 2723, 10744, 7110, 1610, 10379, 14051, 14843, 5392, 4568, 2071, 1065, 2723, 16324, 2080, 2480, 6513, 3735, 22490, 1610, 781, 781, 2749, 13888, 1070, 5050, 10623, 1171, 7851, 1254, 3624, 14051, 1158, 1032, 3782, 3379, 1122, 3245, 8251, 1210, 9280, 2061, 10744, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29518, 29520], 'total_duration': 2828349400, 'prompt_eval_count': 363, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1003809000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1815774000}"

All auto dealers surveyed by this bank reported better sales than in 1974 's depressed fourth quarter . Increases ranged from 8 percent to better than 100 percent . Buyers showed renewed interest in both intermediate and full-sized models . Inventories of automobiles on dealer lots were being kept at normal or low levels . There was little evidence of recovery in the District 's manufacturing sector . Manufacturing employment bottomed out in June 1975 and has been virtually flat since then . Nonetheless , survey results indicate that manufacturing sales expectations are improving . The overall employment picture was somewhat brighter than in the manufacturing sector . Since June , employment has been increasing steadily . Nonetheless , the year-end unemployment rate remained high due to labor force fluctuations .

120,"their responses in April , when only 31 percent reported low spending and 25 percent expected more low spending for the next quarter . Most directors reported quite strong residential construction activity but mostly in just the single-family market . A director whose firm is a major producer of temperature controls cited information indicating that single-family construction was much stronger in the Ninth District than in the nation . He expected that strength to increase in the third quarter . With regard to apartment building , he mentioned a national association of home builders survey , which found a rather sharp second-quarter recovery in multifamily construction that was expected to gain momentum during the remainder of 1976 and into 1977 . Also , a recent Twin Cities metropolitan area apartment survey reported that vacancy rates had declined to quite a low level , a usual sign that a pickup is due . However , many observers felt that rental rates were not high enough to justify new apartment construction in the District . Reports from directors on building activity in their respective areas showed nonresidential construction weaker than residential construction . However , the director whose firm manufactures temperature controls believed nonresidential construction had begun to recover and should be very strong by 1977 , up 10 to 15 percent in constant terms . Directors agreed that economic policies would be a major part in this year 's Presidential campaign .

One director thought that policies regarding inflation would be important to either side because of",0.4,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:49:10.6739986Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.4}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 2005, 1129, 15683, 1065, 4767, 1968, 1507, 1633, 29473, 29538, 29508, 4921, 6513, 3627, 10749, 1072, 29473, 29518, 29550, 4921, 4117, 1448, 3627, 10749, 1122, 1040, 2447, 9017, 1610, 5590, 23418, 6513, 4216, 3735, 19118, 7148, 7123, 1330, 8212, 1065, 1544, 1040, 3460, 29501, 13251, 3436, 1610, 1098, 7627, 5404, 6567, 1117, 1032, 3782, 14644, 1070, 8409, 13954, 23649, 2639, 18656, 1137, 3460, 29501, 13251, 7148, 1171, 1956, 13542, 1065, 1040, 1186, 19386, 8975, 1589, 1065, 1040, 6646, 1610, 1418, 4117, 1137, 7110, 1066, 6015, 1065, 1040, 4776, 9017, 1610, 3094, 4934, 1066, 10353, 4435, 1968, 1168, 7851, 1032, 5050, 14663, 1070, 2379, 2581, 1172, 11679, 1968, 1458, 2187, 1032, 3978, 10995, 2444, 29501, 1132, 4904, 12874, 1065, 3299, 1103, 6498, 7148, 1137, 1171, 4117, 1066, 9124, 14787, 2706, 1040, 24085, 1070, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29552, 1072, 1546, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29555, 1610, 5608, 1968, 1032, 6159, 1088, 5930, 1102, 1986, 2192, 22927, 3466, 10353, 11679, 6513, 1137, 8023, 6171, 8746, 1321, 23811, 1066, 4216, 1032, 3627, 2952, 1968, 1032, 9202, 2260, 1137, 1032, 3856, 1483, 1117, 3708, 1610, 3761, 1968, 2055, 1586, 21800, 3538, 1137, 19576, 8746, 1422, 1227, 2254, 2834, 1066, 16973, 1401, 10353, 7148, 1065, 1040, 8975, 1610, 2066, 3497, 1245, 23418, 1124, 4435, 7123, 1065, 1420, 18144, 5788, 7410, 2611, 1179, 28125, 7148, 1246, 5544, 1589, 19118, 7148, 1610, 3761, 1968, 1040, 7627, 5404, 6567, 7066, 2006, 8409, 13954, 8529, 2611, 1179, 28125, 7148, 1321, 14492, 1066, 10211, 1072, 1791, 1115, 1983, 3735, 1254, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29555, 1968, 1350, 29473, 29508, 29502, 1066, 29473, 29508, 29550, 4921, 1065, 6725, 4239, 1610, 6823, 1502, 6593, 1137, 7406, 10854, 1450, 1115, 1032, 3782, 1512, 1065, 1224, 1647, 1232, 29481, 5888, 1273, 6542, 1610, 781, 781, 6935, 7627, 2422, 1137, 10854, 8985, 21381, 1450, 1115, 3046, 1066, 3245, 2849, 1864, 1070, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29549, 29520], 'total_duration': 2729165800, 'load_duration': 3551300, 'prompt_eval_count': 359, 'prompt_eval_duration': 991251000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1730003000}"
121,"February 11 , 1976 Strong retail sales are the key to a generally optimistic outlook for the Redbook this month . Nearly every District focuses attention on the strength of consumer demand as an indication that the economy may be regaining some of the momentum it lost in the latter months of 1975 . The picture is still far from rosy , but the outlook is distinctly more optimistic . Even though capital goods industries are still weak , the rest of the manufacturing sector is gaining strength . Inventories have been brought into line with sales and new orders are up . Two persistent weak spots—the construction industry 's slump and high urban unemployment—remain gloomy , but inflationary pressures seem to be moderating in several Districts . While there is little disagreement that `` catch-up '' efforts in wage negotiations scheduled for 1976 pose a problem for stabilizing production costs , there are differences of opinion on the likelihood that food prices will rise significantly during the next few months . The financial sector continues to build liquidity rather than expand . Savings are flowing into commercial banks and thrift institutions at very rapid rates .

Concern over possible shortages and bottlenecks appears to have diminished with the slower rate of recovery .

128,"the level of business activity in the respondents ' respective market areas and by the retailers concerning the level of sales in their own firms . Among the manufacturers surveyed , however , expectations of improvements in the level of production in their own firms are slightly less common than a month ago . Survey respondents , both retail and manufacturing , report widespread increases in prices paid , but relatively few such increases in the prices received . Nearly 50 percent of all respondents report paying higher prices during the latest survey period , while fewer than 20 percent report increases in prices received and over 12 percent report receiving lower prices . In the banking sector , there appears to be a moderate upward trend developing in the demand for business loans , which recently has drawn strength from the wholesale and retail trade sectors . Business loan demand is certainly not at desired levels , however , and investment in bankers ' acceptances continues . Both consumer installment and real estate loans show continued strength . The District 's farm income situation improved during August , largely because marketing of the flue-cured crop was well underway and prices were up sharply from last year . With this improvement , total cash farm income for the January-August period registered a 5 percent gain over a year earlier compared with 1 percent at the end of July .

Average flue-cured tobacco prices have trended downward in recent weeks in response to lower grade prices and",0.4,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:49:39.6843801Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.4}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 2005, 2952, 1070, 2723, 7123, 1065, 1040, 10189, 1556, 1232, 18144, 3436, 5788, 1072, 1254, 1040, 12371, 1172, 16710, 1040, 2952, 1070, 7060, 1065, 1420, 1984, 19021, 1610, 14695, 1040, 20013, 11679, 1054, 1968, 4313, 1968, 14647, 1070, 20432, 1065, 1040, 2952, 1070, 5653, 1065, 1420, 1984, 19021, 1228, 7959, 2876, 4066, 1589, 1032, 2870, 4352, 1610, 24772, 10189, 1556, 1968, 2328, 12371, 1072, 15954, 1968, 3032, 24491, 12863, 1065, 9274, 6675, 1968, 1330, 10870, 2432, 2027, 12863, 1065, 1040, 9274, 4642, 1610, 18370, 1114, 29473, 29550, 29502, 4921, 1070, 1312, 10189, 1556, 3032, 10728, 5105, 9274, 2706, 1040, 8113, 11679, 3984, 1968, 2080, 16898, 1589, 29473, 29518, 29502, 4921, 3032, 12863, 1065, 9274, 4642, 1072, 1522, 29473, 29508, 29518, 4921, 3032, 12632, 4657, 9274, 1610, 1328, 1040, 23033, 10410, 1968, 1504, 8813, 1066, 1115, 1032, 23419, 26014, 9924, 11191, 1065, 1040, 6405, 1122, 2723, 16324, 1968, 1458, 6683, 1427, 11189, 7110, 1245, 1040, 26679, 1651, 1072, 12371, 6994, 23782, 1610, 8479, 10744, 6405, 1117, 6553, 1227, 1206, 12553, 6925, 1968, 4313, 1968, 1072, 9310, 1065, 5974, 1172, 1232, 4226, 3001, 11120, 1610, 8597, 12845, 5198, 1234, 1072, 2121, 10258, 16324, 2115, 6085, 7110, 1610, 1183, 8975, 1232, 29481, 7122, 8672, 5388, 12725, 2706, 4396, 1968, 13050, 1864, 7848, 1070, 1040, 1740, 1209, 29501, 29485, 3098, 22716, 1171, 1930, 1684, 1896, 1072, 9274, 1422, 1350, 26770, 1245, 2200, 1647, 1610, 3094, 1224, 14972, 1968, 3870, 8645, 7122, 8672, 1122, 1040, 5392, 29501, 22343, 1237, 3984, 11796, 1032, 29473, 29550, 4921, 9124, 1522, 1032, 1647, 6353, 7499, 1163, 29473, 29508, 4921, 1206, 1040, 1716, 1070, 5166, 1610, 781, 781, 29509, 4832, 1740, 1209, 29501, 29485, 3098, 27633, 9274, 1274, 9924, 1054, 1828, 1818, 1065, 6159, 5355, 1065, 3667, 1066, 4657, 12914, 9274, 1072, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29549, 29520], 'total_duration': 2757040500, 'load_duration': 5895400, 'prompt_eval_count': 345, 'prompt_eval_duration': 980344000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1767853000}"
129,"September 15 , 1976 Judging from our latest survey of Fifth District business conditions , the level of activity among manufacturers showed little change in the past month . The level of shipments , in fact , has remained essentially unchanged since June , while the volume of new orders has registered minimal declines in each of the past 3 months . Backlogs of orders and finished goods inventories are down somewhat from July , and stocks of materials are reported to have risen slightly since then . Manufacturing inventories remain somewhat above desired levels as does current plant and equipment capacity . Retailers apparently experienced some improvement in sales during August , but at least one respondent attributes this to heavy price markdowns . Sales of big-ticket items continue to lag relative to total sales . Demand for bank loans remains soft . In the agricultural sector , dry weather for the past several weeks has damaged pastures and most major crops in wide areas of the District . Survey responses of District manufacturers exhibit much the same pattern as in the past 2 months , suggesting a stable level of shipments , some weakness in the volume of new orders , and a small decline in order backlogs . Some accumulation of materials inventories in August is indicated , but over one-third of the respondents report reduced stocks of finished goods . Thirty-seven percent of the manufacturers still feel current inventory levels are higher than desired .

Steel shipments are expected to rise 11 percent in 1977 to about 100 million tons . Inventories of steel users and steel service centers have been reduced to desired levels . The precise level of steel shipments in 1977 will depend on the volume of imports , mainly from Japan , which is expected to increase . Most analysts now expect sales of both cars and trucks to increase in l977—to a new record in the case of trucks . Sales of recreational vehicles are also expected to show another large rise . The sharp contrast between very poor sales of small cars and strong sales of intermediate and standard size types continues . The smallest auto company , which produces small cars almost exclusively , admits to a very precarious financial position .

A New York-style blackout is believed to be remote in Chicago or other district areas because of lesser dependence on purchased power and many more interconnections with neighboring systems . The recent depreciation of the dollar relative to foreign currencies is helping U.S. steel and equipment producers who must meet competition from Germany and Japan . The effect appears to be more through holding down imports , rather than through increasing exports . Business managers are displeased with the energy program that appears to be shaping up in legislation now under consideration . They insist that incentives to develop new supplies are inadequate and that proposed measures to reduce consumption would be inefficient and vary costly to implement . While capital equipment output appears to be rising overall , demand for heavy capital goods related to capacity expansion remains sluggish . Sales of most types of farm equipment are running below last year . Heavy trucks , trailers , light construction equipment , and various components are relatively strong . Sales of energy-related equipment are good , but not up to expectations . Orders for machine tools , especially those for auto companies , are well above last year and further gains are expected in 1978 .

An economist in retail trade expects slower growth in disposable income and increased personal saving rates will hold overall gains in real consumer expenditures to about a 3 % annual rate of increase this half . He does not believe that the rapid rate of increase in retail sales last month can be sustained , nor is it consistent with forecasts of only 4-to-5 % quarterly gains",-0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:50:26.5169895Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 10788, 2200, 1647, 1610, 3155, 4388, 1160, 17206, 1137, 10213, 9950, 3188, 6257, 1228, 1633, 7959, 3515, 2163, 2706, 1235, 1668, 29481, 1065, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29502, 29501, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29508, 1072, 4677, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29552, 1968, 1065, 19647, 1070, 1040, 2407, 1137, 17066, 1117, 25781, 5105, 1589, 1065, 2163, 16540, 1610, 10089, 1255, 1072, 15321, 9950, 3188, 4104, 1254, 1392, 6567, 1228, 6513, 1066, 1115, 1206, 1164, 1312, 29501, 2304, 2254, 1072, 1390, 4685, 1115, 3887, 1610, 12317, 1218, 6271, 1072, 5903, 21020, 22549, 4456, 1206, 6925, 1930, 3515, 1032, 1647, 4352, 1968, 6200, 1392, 2560, 17939, 6513, 1032, 3978, 1036, 12320, 14156, 1065, 5903, 21020, 22549, 2706, 4396, 1610, 2186, 1040, 1567, 1789, 1968, 2023, 1193, 1148, 1072, 13667, 1608, 11392, 22549, 1228, 1633, 7959, 3515, 2200, 1647, 1232, 29481, 6925, 1072, 1158, 1036, 2332, 23630, 1390, 11364, 7271, 1066, 6015, 2163, 22549, 1610, 6823, 1502, 1072, 11523, 6131, 1163, 12845, 12050, 1228, 10198, 1065, 1420, 8812, 1452, 26908, 1122, 12845, 10749, 1610, 4895, 2838, 7060, 22490, 1065, 4396, 1422, 3243, 8754, 1066, 1032, 1647, 6353, 1968, 1509, 12371, 1172, 7112, 14599, 1693, 1610, 1098, 7627, 1070, 1032, 10552, 4911, 8418, 14599, 1362, 1137, 26410, 22490, 1065, 8672, 1072, 1164, 10982, 28069, 2675, 2254, 20706, 1070, 27808, 1047, 2006, 1122, 5375, 29306, 1072, 17979, 29501, 1891, 12050, 1450, 4685, 3168, 1828, 4205, 12845, 10749, 1610, 1862, 4388, 1160, 1065, 12371, 6994, 28958, 26410, 6825, 1065, 13529, 1290, 8672, 1072, 8251, 4095, 15053, 8746, 1390, 3168, 8312, 22490, 1065, 2121, 12845, 27808, 1047, 2006, 1066, 1452, 1032, 29473, 29538, 2007, 10326, 5106, 1070, 6015, 1224, 3563, 1610, 1418, 2003, 1227, 3859, 1137, 1040, 9189, 5106, 1070, 6015, 1065, 12371, 7060, 2200, 2870, 1309, 1115, 26627, 1968, 5446, 1117, 1146, 11420, 1163, 20680, 29481, 1070, 1633, 29473, 29549, 29501, 1300, 29501, 29550, 2007, 9017, 1114, 22490, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 1155, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 3098816200, 'load_duration': 6596600, 'prompt_eval_count': 363, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1001413000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 2087519000}"

A reduced pace in consumer spending , lower output in steel , and a slower rate of inventory accumulation account for the expected moderation in overall activity . Capital goods recovery continues rather mixed . Bankers report strong loan demand and a few expect liquidity pressures may develop in the months ahead . Directors , financial officers , and economists contacted generally expressed confidence that the economy will continue to expand for the next several quarters but at a moderated pace from the first half of 1977 .

Residential construction remains strong , while nonresidential construction activity is making a year-end surge . But industry spokesmen predict a slowing in construction activity by mid-1978 . The demand for home mortgages remains very active , but savings and loan associations suggest market demands will slow in coming months . Most petroleum refiners continue to put aside plans for plant and equipment spending until a national energy policy is established . Because profit margins have improved , the number of cattle on feed in Texas is up sharply from the level a year ago . Department store executives indicate Christmas sales should be excellent this year . Thanksgiving sales were l4 percent above a year ago , end December sales may well top that rate of increase .

144,"planting is running on or ahead of schedule , and in the southern part of the District the wheat has germinated and is beginning to grow . According to one director from an agricultural area , the quality of the wheat stand is excellent and the crop prospects for the coming year are `` very good when compared with this time last year . '' If the new crop continues to receive rain , wheat pasture will be available for grazing and some ranchers will probably take advantage of this cheap source of feed . Thus , prices for light cattle may strengthen as a result of this activity . Because most farmers were uncertain about the details of the new farm program when they started planting their wheat , acreage in the District 's major producing states is expected to be about equal to 1977 levels . However , as farmers become more familiar with the program , some of the crop will probably be destroyed so that their eligibility for full Government benefits will not be jeopardized . This strategy may be employed because , with the huge stocks of wheat now on hand , the price outlook for the coming year is not bright for producers . Most Tenth District bankers contacted report strong loan demand , especially in energy-related businesses and in real estate loans , both residential and commercial . Consumer installment lending is also increasing rapidly , with credit card use and auto loans responsible for most of the gains",0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:50:45.025949Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 18839, 1056, 1117, 4590, 1124, 1210, 7048, 1070, 10210, 1968, 1072, 1065, 1040, 12995, 1512, 1070, 1040, 8975, 1040, 28903, 1427, 23925, 6267, 1072, 1117, 6166, 1066, 3101, 1610, 7354, 1066, 1392, 7627, 1245, 1164, 23583, 3466, 1968, 1040, 4813, 1070, 1040, 28903, 2644, 1117, 8867, 1072, 1040, 22716, 26908, 1122, 1040, 4292, 1647, 1228, 5776, 1983, 1947, 1507, 7499, 1163, 1224, 1495, 2200, 1647, 1610, 10610, 1815, 1040, 1401, 22716, 11120, 1066, 6324, 8064, 1968, 28903, 3377, 1250, 1390, 1115, 3400, 1122, 27772, 1056, 1072, 1509, 27446, 1172, 1390, 3817, 2156, 8627, 1070, 1224, 10418, 3600, 1070, 6343, 1610, 7878, 1968, 9274, 1122, 2829, 23905, 1761, 16742, 1158, 1032, 1972, 1070, 1224, 7123, 1610, 6286, 1848, 17898, 1422, 13286, 1452, 1040, 4930, 1070, 1040, 1401, 7122, 2775, 1507, 1358, 3542, 5868, 1056, 1420, 28903, 1968, 1032, 1729, 1233, 1065, 1040, 8975, 1232, 29481, 3782, 16113, 5373, 1117, 4117, 1066, 1115, 1452, 7298, 1066, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29555, 6925, 1610, 3761, 1968, 1158, 17898, 3495, 1448, 8996, 1163, 1040, 2775, 1968, 1509, 1070, 1040, 22716, 1390, 3817, 1115, 12343, 1347, 1137, 1420, 1407, 1094, 3800, 1122, 2941, 10482, 7964, 1390, 1227, 1115, 2986, 1178, 1256, 2100, 1610, 1619, 7981, 1761, 1115, 15443, 1864, 1968, 1163, 1040, 6169, 22549, 1070, 28903, 1823, 1124, 1789, 1968, 1040, 4912, 1343, 6587, 1122, 1040, 4292, 1647, 1117, 1227, 7601, 1122, 23630, 1610, 5590, 1088, 8784, 8975, 5974, 1172, 29098, 3032, 3735, 10744, 6405, 1968, 4780, 1065, 4176, 29501, 10414, 9457, 1072, 1065, 2121, 10258, 16324, 1968, 2328, 19118, 1072, 8148, 1610, 6272, 4740, 5198, 1234, 1073, 3338, 1117, 1603, 7256, 14867, 1968, 1163, 6951, 4916, 1706, 1072, 4795, 16324, 8100, 1122, 1848, 1070, 1040, 22490, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 2562450800, 'load_duration': 4128400, 'prompt_eval_count': 335, 'prompt_eval_duration': 912208000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1644390000}"

Respondents generally reported that inventory levels were building up .

Capital spending , on the other hand , continues generally weak , with a quite visible portion of this spending being used for pollution control . Residential construction remains strong , though the rate of increase has plateaued in most areas . Because of low grain prices and high drought-induced production costs , many Western farmers are experiencing serious cash-flow problems and rural economies are somewhat depressed . The much-noted forest fires of the west have been mainly confined to wilderness and park areas and are unlikely to have any noticeable impact on the timber supply . Retail sales continue strong throughout the district . In Salt Lake City , sales of appliances and other big ticket items are matching the rapid pace of residential construction . The largest gains of the year are currently being experienced by Portland 's largest department store . A northwestern distributor of foreign cars reported the best August since 1973 , with sales up 42 % from July . Several areas in both southern California and Idaho reported that retail sales continue to increase at 15 percent over 1976 . Capital spending still appears generally weak in the West . One Oregon bank reported that most of its commercial loans were for debt restructuring or acquisition of other companies . Another Oregon bank observed that much investment was for transportation items .

Orders and production in several capital goods industries have picked up in the past couple of months , although reporters point out that boom conditions have not developed . Orders for large electrical motors , thermostats and other control devices , industrial screws and bolts , fabricated products , railroad cars , and industrial lubricating equipment were reported to have increased recently . Representatives of the aircraft industry also reported a high level of activity . On the other hand , orders for such items as telecommunications equipment , farm equipment , and radiators for heavy equipment were reported to have remained relatively stable . While recent gains have occurred in the capital goods industry , the general consensus among businessmen is that the President 's energy proposals will have adverse effects on capital spending in the near term . It is the businessmen 's view that the proposals have created more uncertainty , and hence , have increased the difficulty of predicting costs .

159,"fixed exchange rates is of singular importance . On the other hand , when our major creditor , Saudi Arabia , insists that something be done , token intervention may be a wise near-term political expedient . Houthakker believes intervention may occasionally be necessary when market conditions become disorderly as may have been the case in the early days of the new year . Further intervention , however , is not necessary and not in the best interests of the United States . Lower import prices would help meet Germany 's and Japan 's concern about inflation and provide them with more elbow room to pursue expansionary policies . Although declines in the dollar do contribute to our inflation , the magnitude of the impact so far is one we can live with . Unlike 1972 and 1973 , the rise in the prices of our imports have not been accompanied by sharp increases in the price of exported goods . Tobin does not object to short-run intervention to stabilize irrational day-to-day speculation but does oppose trying to peg the exchange rate . Tobin doubts that the dollar would be overvalued if Germany and Japan were operating at reasonable levels of capacity , and questions whether it is overvalued anyway . Recent declines reflect portfolio shifts by OPEC investors that have little to do with the fundamental value of the dollar . A policy which would enhance confidence in the economic recovery and boost the stock market would help to restore the capital inflow .

The region 's economists are , for the most part , considerably more pessimistic about the economic outlook than are most businessmen . At a recent gathering of business economists nine out of twelve assigned a probability in excess of 50 percent to the prospect of a recession in late 1978 or early 1979 . Consumer debt , the rate of inflation and the Federal Reserve 's response were the basis for their gloomy forecasts . Professors Eckstein and Samuelson were available for comment this month . Both respondents agree that there is a very real possibility of a `` credit crunch '' developing in the second half of this year , although neither believes that the present level of interest rates will necessarily lead to this outcome . They also agreed that while an overly ambitious attempt to slow the rate of money growth could easily produce a recession , the economy 's prospects in the absence of this policy are for slower but still acceptable real growth in the months immediately ahead .",0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:51:36.5657597Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 15736, 1040, 1675, 2587, 1070, 5166, 1610, 1183, 24022, 5547, 1065, 13495, 2218, 6551, 1117, 2850, 1056, 1983, 1930, 1610, 9105, 1382, 1172, 1228, 11731, 1722, 1035, 8301, 1263, 1452, 1040, 4205, 3131, 1070, 1040, 9493, 1072, 1509, 2369, 1137, 9950, 3188, 1761, 1115, 1032, 3054, 2254, 3521, 1330, 1224, 5136, 1117, 1227, 3586, 1124, 5463, 3427, 1610, 8597, 1032, 3782, 10552, 4911, 8418, 1072, 1032, 3243, 19704, 3032, 1137, 1289, 16845, 1838, 17611, 1072, 3375, 6433, 1842, 1968, 1458, 6015, 1158, 1040, 9493, 7102, 1364, 1968, 1228, 3627, 1072, 11699, 1610, 1183, 5192, 1232, 29481, 4388, 2351, 1228, 1968, 1122, 1040, 1848, 1512, 1968, 25781, 1448, 1052, 1177, 1089, 4088, 1452, 1040, 7406, 1343, 6587, 1589, 1228, 1848, 2723, 2897, 1610, 2562, 1032, 6159, 18011, 1070, 2723, 4388, 2351, 10310, 1343, 1070, 13921, 12168, 1032, 11734, 1065, 12222, 1070, 29473, 29550, 29502, 4921, 1066, 1040, 12218, 1070, 1032, 1705, 2661, 1065, 4677, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29551, 1210, 3703, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29555, 29542, 1610, 6272, 4740, 11721, 1968, 1040, 5106, 1070, 21381, 1072, 1040, 12420, 23017, 1232, 29481, 3667, 1422, 1040, 7219, 1122, 1420, 20488, 13724, 20680, 29481, 1610, 8797, 1502, 1181, 1374, 7327, 1072, 4925, 29486, 15582, 1422, 3400, 1122, 5285, 1224, 2870, 1610, 8597, 10189, 1556, 6629, 1137, 1504, 1117, 1032, 1983, 2121, 10833, 1070, 1032, 5776, 6951, 2207, 3818, 10610, 11191, 1065, 1040, 2444, 3563, 1070, 1224, 1647, 1968, 6200, 9927, 16070, 1137, 1040, 2937, 2952, 1070, 2913, 8746, 1390, 12635, 2504, 1066, 1224, 14888, 1610, 2074, 1603, 6593, 1137, 2080, 1164, 1522, 1114, 28981, 5004, 1066, 4712, 1040, 5106, 1070, 3213, 6825, 1597, 5829, 7840, 1032, 1705, 2661, 1968, 1040, 9493, 1232, 29481, 26908, 1065, 1040, 14609, 1070, 1224, 5688, 1228, 1122, 26410, 1330, 2077, 19404, 2121, 6825, 1065, 1040, 4138, 6115, 7048, 1610, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 2822156800, 'load_duration': 7601000, 'prompt_eval_count': 353, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1008474000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1803660000}"

Business capital outlays are expected to rise this year , both for equipment and structures . Demand for farm equipment is conspicuously weak . The long severe winter has hampered construction activity to an abnormal degree . Demand for credit appears to be strengthening , especially for bank loans to larger businesses . Interest rates are expected to move at least moderately higher as demand for credit increases while savings inflows to Thrift institutions remain slow . Knowledgeable business managers in the district believe that the coal strike negotiations have been `` bungled . '' The pact presented to the miners for ratification took away some benefits won earlier , and attempted to place unacceptable penalties on wildcat strikes . ( These views come from management observers . ) Nevertheless , a settlement is expected soon with various key sections rewritten . All affected activities are expected to rebound after the coal strike is settled . However , the experience adds to inflationary pressures .

The amount of office space under construction in the Dallas area has more than doubled since February to nearly 6.5 million square feet . Residential construction activity remains strong , although higher prices and mortgage rates are cutting into sales of new homes . The expansion in construction activity is hampered by shortages of cement , but surprisingly , prices have remained fairly stable . Recently , one major supplier attempted to raise prices but failed as other firms refused to follow suite . Imports of cement from Mexico are easing shortages in some areas , and there are several new cement plants under construction in Texas . Prices of other building materials in short supply are responding to the demand pressures . Demand for real estate and construction loans is leading the rise in lending activity at commercial banks . Some of the recent real estate loans were to applicants turning to banks because S & Ls were unable to meet their requests . Banks are becoming increasingly concerned about their liquidity positions . Loan volume at District banks is running well ahead of budgeted levels , and 20- to 30-percent gains in loan volume from year-ago levels are not uncommon . Substantial volumes of loans are being `` laid off '' to banks outside the District .

171,", but these shortages were not expected to affect production . Plant managers , mechanics and mold makers were also cited as specialized skills that were in relative tight supply by one director . For the most part , retail sales in May and early June were judged to have been on target . Nevertheless , for the year as a whole , several merchants felt that sales were below expectations . As a consequence , retailers viewed their inventories as somewhat high , but voiced little concern over their ability to work off any excesses once the summer sales season rolled into gear . Automotive sales have been brisk in recent months . One industry economist attributed the current spurt to a combination of `` catch-up '' buying after the past winter and consumers attempt to beat price increases due on the new model year cars . Thus , he expected sales to taper off considerably later in the summer . Outside of the retail sector , the outlook for capital spending in the District appears to have strengthened . The president of a major utility reported that his firm was experiencing record growth that , in turn , was triggering an increase in capital spending plans . Reports from the directors of the Buffalo branch suggested a noticeable brightening in the outlook . A major Rochester firm has commenced construction of a major facility . At the same time , several manufacturing firms in Buffalo are going ahead with planned plant expansions .

Looking ahead to the next six months , local merchants have widely varying expectations . Although some are fairly optimistic and look for first quarter sales to be as much as 11 percent higher than year-earlier levels , others are more conservative in their projections and expect to simply match early 1978 volume . None of the retailers contacted has assumed a tax cut in his forecast . Local bankers say loan demand remains generally strong this month . Consumer loans continue to grow and C & I loans are reported to be 1 to 7 percent over year-end figures . Business loan demand is slightly ahead of planned levels overall . Bankers contacted say they have seen the underlying demand for business loans grow slowly and steadily over the past several months , so that unconventional loans are less necessary . As for the future , bankers look for continued strength in loan demand over the next two quarters . One contact feels that part of this continuing demand growth will come from the retailing sector .

173,"March 15 , 1978 Retail sales are reported strong in most parts of the District , though the coal strike in Utah and heavy rains in Southern California have weakened sales somewhat . The inventory picture is mixed with some excess inventories reported in Southern California due to rain-depressed sales and thin inventories in the Pacific Northwest due to slow shipments of goods from the Northeast . Western industry continues to grow , with aluminum and aerospace doing particularly well . While consumer and real estate loan demand remains strong , business loan demand is still flat . While retail sales in Northern California appear to be running up to 12 percent above year-ago levels , sales in Southern California have been dampened by unusually heavy and frequent rains . Grocery stores in that area report sales to be both less than last year and less than planned . Retail sales of non-durables in the Los Angeles area are very slow due to bad weather , and year-to-year declines of 10 percent in weekly volumes are not unusual . However , in dry weeks sales activity shoots ahead . This start-stop pattern has made inventory management rather difficult and there are some reports of excess inventories .

As construction activity has gained some momentum this spring , shortages of skilled workers and bricklayers are beginning to show up . However , such shortages are not viewed by homebuilders as an insurmountable problem and apprentice programs are bulging . Homebuilders are beginning to express some fear about a sharp decline in home demand in the future . Their special concerns are the possibility of disintermediation , rising mortgage rates , and the continuation of sharply rising costs of building supplies . Builders report that the cost of building materials rose about 15 percent last year . Representatives of some savings and loan associations reported a net outflow of deposits in April . This was said to reflect improved yields on short- and medium-term securities as well as renewed interest in the stock market . Representatives of the savings and loan industry report increased advertising budgets and more offerings of premiums in an attempt to maintain or advance their market share of savings . With strong demand for mortgages , considerable upward pressure has been placed on mortgage interest rates . Rates have advanced about 1/4 of one percentage point in the St. Louis and Memphis areas since last month .

Considerable concern was also expressed by savings and loan representatives about the recent action of the Federal Reserve which allows automatic transfers between savings and demand accounts",-0.5,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:52:48.635846Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.5}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 2005, 3460, 29501, 13251, 3436, 1610, 1183, 3243, 2513, 1620, 2350, 1070, 1401, 9807, 1065, 1040, 1430, 29491, 7466, 3466, 1427, 1227, 3551, 10560, 1276, 1369, 1968, 8735, 1056, 6085, 3735, 2379, 7060, 1610, 1904, 7148, 7123, 1427, 14786, 1509, 14787, 1224, 8242, 1968, 3253, 2059, 1070, 21567, 8201, 1072, 19004, 23712, 1228, 6166, 1066, 2115, 1350, 1610, 3761, 1968, 2027, 3253, 2059, 1228, 1227, 17629, 1254, 2379, 5439, 1172, 1158, 1164, 2256, 1092, 13790, 1290, 3468, 1072, 1722, 1882, 1303, 7802, 1228, 6546, 3848, 1610, 7202, 5439, 1172, 1228, 6166, 1066, 4840, 1509, 5581, 1452, 1032, 10995, 18236, 1065, 2379, 6405, 1065, 1040, 4205, 1610, 7491, 3609, 11632, 1228, 1040, 10833, 1070, 1472, 2414, 4045, 1120, 1968, 12630, 18990, 8746, 1968, 1072, 1040, 5780, 1120, 1070, 26770, 12630, 7734, 1070, 4435, 14447, 1610, 9013, 1172, 3032, 1137, 1040, 3202, 1070, 4435, 7837, 9304, 1452, 29473, 29508, 29550, 4921, 2200, 1647, 1610, 18659, 5855, 1070, 1509, 18433, 1072, 10744, 26731, 6513, 1032, 3280, 1343, 5124, 1070, 11967, 1814, 1065, 4767, 1610, 1619, 1171, 1541, 1066, 8735, 12725, 19702, 1124, 3253, 29501, 1072, 11080, 29501, 7358, 22982, 1986, 1158, 1930, 1158, 14061, 1054, 2913, 1065, 1040, 6524, 3436, 1610, 18659, 5855, 1070, 1040, 18433, 1072, 10744, 5547, 3032, 8251, 13664, 9094, 29481, 1072, 1448, 3173, 1510, 1070, 17085, 29481, 1065, 1164, 5004, 1066, 9855, 1210, 9438, 1420, 3436, 4866, 1070, 18433, 1610, 3094, 3735, 6405, 1122, 6229, 29489, 2059, 1968, 16830, 26014, 7171, 1427, 1518, 7606, 1124, 18990, 2913, 8746, 1610, 1167, 1770, 1274, 10791, 1452, 29473, 29508, 29516, 29549, 1070, 1392, 14590, 2073, 1065, 1040, 1430, 29491, 7466, 1072, 6779, 1489, 1046, 5788, 2622, 2200, 2870, 1610, 781, 781, 22200, 1952, 1290, 5136, 1171, 1603, 12326, 1254, 18433, 1072, 10744, 21327, 1452, 1040, 6159, 3760, 1070, 1040, 12420, 23017, 1458, 6744, 17105, 1971, 18324, 2212, 18433, 1072, 6405, 10623, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 1155, 29502, 29491, 29550, 29520], 'total_duration': 2863409500, 'load_duration': 2995800, 'prompt_eval_count': 362, 'prompt_eval_duration': 979115000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1876117000}"

Additionally , new Comprehensive Employment Training Act regulations that limit CETA employment to 18 months , effective October 1 , and heavy federal budget cuts will nudge unemployment even higher at a time of anticipated slow economic activity . For example , more than 1,500 CETA workers in Atlanta are expected to be laid off by the end of the year and 182 are scheduled to lose their jobs in East Baton Rouge Parish .

Tourists dealt with higher gasoline prices by continuing to visit attractions within a shorter driving range . Campground business remains very weak throughout the District because of a reluctance to travel too far with gas-guzzling recreational vehicles . Abundant rainfall throughout the District has enhanced yield prospects for crops , particularly soybeans , corn , peanuts , and cotton , and improved pastures . Resultant higher quality pastures helped maintain the good physical condition of cattle herds during the hot summer months .

They are puzzled about the recent turmoil in the foreign exchange , gold , and commodity markets , and they offer conflicting advice on how to deal with it . Professor Eckstein believes that the third quarter 's growth was achieved at the cost of a more severe downturn in the months ahead . He expects inflation to continue near its current pace for several more months , however , despite the imminent slowdown . In Eckstein ' s view , the decline of the dollar on foreign exchange markets is primarily the result of domestic economic performance . He cites the high U.S. core inflation rate as one important contributor to the dollar 's weakness .

Electronic components , aluminum and steel were identified as particular problem areas . Several companies mentioned unusually sharp increases in the prices of petrochemical and glass products and one firm was very concerned about recent increases in trucking rates . Labor shortages seem to be becoming both more widespread and more critical . Difficulties in obtaining engineers , especially electrical engineers , were mentioned by most large firms . There is also a severe shortage of computer software people and , in some areas , skilled assembly workers . The head of one large firm stated that the wage guidelines , with which they must comply because of large defense contracts , are seriously hindering their ability to recruit needed workers .

184,"significantly slowed real estate borrowing at District banks . Interim construction loans , for example , remain among the strongest areas of lending activity . High interest rates , however , have slowed mortgage warehousing activity as mortgage bankers face negative spreads between the yields on the mortgages they sell and the rates they must pay for short-term financing . Lending activity at District banks remains strong in most other loan categories , although the rate of growth has ebbed to the slowest pace this year . Loan demands by customers outside the District remain weaker than regional demands . Several bankers have expressed concern over unfair competition from foreign banks . They cite the ability of these banks to undercut prices because of differences in regulation . Preliminary results from our latest survey of agribankers indicate the financial positions of District farmers are much improved from a year ago . The improvement is attributed primarily to larger crop yields and higher grain prices . Although farm loan demand remains strong , bankers report fewer loan extensions and an improved rate of loan repayment over the same period last year .

One Oregon department store noted a 15-20 percent increase in December sales over last year . Merchants in two Washington counties reported record Christmas sales , some exceeding last year by 25 percent . While other areas reported similarly strong sales , at least one observer noted that merchants were approaching 1979 with caution and keeping a sharp eye on inventories . Auto sales , on the other hand , have slowed considerably throughout the District . In Salt Lake City , dealers reported a significant drop in new car sales in December .

A survey of department stores showed little improvement in unit sales , while sales of new cars have picked up slightly from their previously very depressed levels . Some pickup in speculative residential building is underway , and nonresidential construction continues its relatively strong pace . Lending at most S & L 's and commercial banks is showing slight response to declining interest rates . Manufacturing output is soft , with some improvement in orders from suppliers to the construction industry . Drought conditions are having substantial impact on agricultural production in the District . Unit sales at department stores throughout most of the District remain lackluster , although stores in the Houston and Austin areas report increases from last year 's levels . Credit sales are rebounding from the low level following March 14 but remains a smaller proportion of total sales than in the previous year . Department stores continue to rely heavily on sales and promotions to generate store traffic and move merchandise . Inventory levels are generally described as desirable , although a few retailers have excess stock where sales have not met projections . The outlook for the rest of the year is optimistic , with an aggressive sales push planned for the Christmas season .

Bankers report many inquiries for terms on auto loans , but most are reluctant to borrow at the prevailing 14.5- percent annual rate . The decline in interest rates has reduced inventory costs for dealers , but weak sales forced the bankruptcy of a major Dallas Ford dealer last month . The outlook for residential construction has improved slightly . Inventories of unsold new homes are not excessive . Sales of both new and used homes have picked up slightly in the last two months with the decline in mortgage rates and increased availability of municipal bond funding in the District . Corporate relocations to this area also continue to bolster sales .

The district 's corn and soybean crops , however , could still be quite good if they get adequate moisture in August . In spite of the drought , farm income in the district has stopped falling .

High technology and defense-related industries are performing particularly well . The major exceptions to this pattern are the housing and automobile industries , which are exhibiting considerable weakness . Most districts report very strong volumes of retail sales—a phenomenon which several reports ascribed to a pervasive `` spend it now '' psychology on the part of consumers . Reports of continued inflation are also widespread . With the exception of home mortgages , loan volumes were reported to be strong in most districts prior to the recent runup in rates . Spotty current reports indicate a subsequent weakening of loan demand . Financial institutions are experiencing considerable conversion of savings deposits into money-market liabilities , and there is widespread concern about the consequent effect on the cost of funds and institutional profitability . The agricultural sector is apparently in good shape in most districts . Most districts report generally strong industrial activity . New York , for example , reports brisk new orders and generally steady activity . Minneapolis finds industrial output and employment expanding ; manufacturing employment is up 14 percent from a year ago . Dallas finds continued , but slowing , growth in manufacturing .

Two-thirds of our respondents report sales down over the past month and all respondents report a relative decline in big ticket items . In some areas where sales held steady it was attributed solely to aggressive promotion and price cutting . Despite an overall decline in the level of retail inventories a large majority of respondents now feel that stocks are too high . Price increases were somewhat less widespread this month than in recent survey periods . Over one-half of our manufacturing respondents report no change in prices received . Twenty percent report no change in prices paid . Among retail respondents prices received and paid , on average , showed little or no change over the month . Respondents ' expectations of future activity , however , deteriorated sharply over the past month . Over 90 percent of the manufacturing respondents now expect the level of business activity nationally to worsen over the next six months , and a majority expect a decline in their respective market areas .

The picture in Massachusetts is complicated by a heavy weekend snowstorm that closed most stores for a day .

One positive development in this month 's reports is evidence of further progress in bringing down the rate of inflation . Only a third of purchasing managers surveyed reported prices increased in the past month ; earlier in the year and for most of 1980 , two-thirds normally reported higher prices . Commodity prices have softened and are expected to remain soft for some time . Not everyone is happy about lower prices : the building materials executive reports that although costs are up , his firm has been forced to price its products below 1980 levels . Professors Houthakker and Samuelson were available for comment this month . Houthakker is disappointed that fiscal policy for 1982 will not reduce the budget deficit , and he sympathizes somewhat with our foreign trading partners who object to domestic policies . Nevertheless , he believes there is no need to change monetary policy at this time . Houthakker recommends a temporary shift of attention to M-2 if a conflict should arise between attaining the M-2 guideline and the M-1B guideline . Once the NOW account adjustment is complete and the M-2 and M-1B guidelines are once again mutually consistent , the Fed should return its attention to M-1B .

Retailers are generally satisfied with Christmas sales . Final reports are not yet in but the consensus is that sales were late but fairly good . Among manufacturers there is a suggestion of a slight weakening since November ; some of the smaller high technology companies are starting to see declines in orders . The well publicized shortage of natural gas in Massachusetts has passed ; it does not appear to have had a major impact on business activity . Retailers report that Christmas sales were vigorous , particularly in the final days . However , it will not be possible to know whether the 1980 season was profitable until final inventories are completed . Although the volume figures are encouraging , sales and markdowns were widespread . Retail inventories are under control with the possible exception of some consumer durables . Surveys of New England purchasing agents suggest a slight decline in manufacturing production and new orders since November . Several sources have mentioned that some of the smaller manufacturers of computers and other high technology products are beginning to see declines in orders and backlogs .

On the other hand , two large high technology companies in the instruments and electronic components industries report that orders in December were strong relative to the rest of 1980",0.3,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:55:06.1821844Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 22418, 4852, 29473, 29518, 29551, 1968, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29551, 29508, 21219, 7123, 1065, 1040, 4973, 8975, 1117, 13050, 1289, 12015, 2622, 1040, 2200, 4458, 4289, 3032, 1968, 1072, 1848, 10189, 1556, 1279, 1227, 3185, 4013, 3782, 5203, 1122, 3245, 2641, 1210, 7639, 1065, 1040, 2447, 3624, 4138, 1610, 9105, 1382, 1172, 1228, 7509, 14439, 1163, 8184, 7060, 1610, 10990, 8727, 1228, 1227, 3551, 1065, 1330, 1040, 25105, 1117, 1137, 7060, 1422, 4677, 1330, 12503, 1947, 1610, 14695, 20013, 1504, 1117, 1032, 20136, 1070, 1032, 6311, 1246, 3357, 1056, 2622, 5117, 3521, 1509, 1070, 1040, 7768, 2254, 6282, 5567, 1228, 6383, 1066, 1800, 4568, 2071, 1065, 9404, 1610, 1183, 1930, 1566, 2100, 3253, 1233, 1070, 4997, 5903, 1065, 17023, 1427, 5336, 3521, 1146, 2003, 1227, 5073, 1066, 1274, 1321, 1032, 3782, 5856, 1124, 2723, 7123, 1610, 9105, 1382, 1172, 3032, 1137, 8184, 7060, 1422, 15836, 15906, 1968, 7079, 1065, 1040, 2248, 2970, 1610, 3761, 1968, 1146, 1390, 1227, 1115, 3340, 1066, 1641, 3929, 1040, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29551, 29502, 4070, 1171, 28590, 2764, 2248, 9950, 3188, 1228, 8136, 1610, 6568, 1040, 8299, 11157, 1228, 22653, 1968, 7060, 1072, 2484, 4022, 29481, 1422, 24491, 1610, 9105, 1382, 9950, 3188, 1228, 1684, 3370, 1163, 1040, 3340, 6619, 1070, 1509, 12845, 6366, 3329, 1610, 6789, 1101, 1614, 1070, 2218, 6551, 22088, 12535, 4165, 1032, 6311, 18236, 1065, 15954, 5653, 1072, 1401, 9404, 2622, 5117, 1610, 15991, 8059, 1274, 7851, 1137, 1509, 1070, 1040, 7768, 20013, 1070, 19286, 1072, 1567, 2254, 6282, 4844, 1228, 6166, 1066, 1800, 4568, 2071, 1065, 9404, 1072, 1620, 26618, 1610, 781, 781, 3254, 1040, 1567, 1789, 1968, 1757, 3243, 2254, 6282, 5567, 1065, 1040, 18705, 1072, 13944, 8844, 18677, 3032, 1137, 9404, 1065, 5693, 1422, 3735, 8754, 1066, 1040, 2614, 1070, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29551, 29502, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29538, 29520], 'total_duration': 2872669300, 'load_duration': 230801300, 'prompt_eval_count': 350, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1049610000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1593886000}"

The winter wheat crop is in some danger due to lack of moisture . Loan demand at commercial banks has weakened recently , with loans to the energy industry an exception . Retail Sales and Inventories Most Tenth District retailers indicate that total dollar sales in 1980 were 5-10 per cent greater than in 1979 . But sales in December 1980 and January 1981 have not shown that much strength in most areas of the District . Sales have been strongest in durable goods and higher priced items , primarily quality apparel . Most retailers expect the current softness of total sales to continue , at least through the first and second quarters . A majority of retailers continue to report negligible merchandise cost increases in recent months are reducing upward pressure on retail prices . Most retailers note recent downward pressure on profit margins because of increases in advertising expenditures , utility bills , and other operational expenses . The recent weakness in total dollar sales leaves most retailers in the Tenth District with inventory levels that are slightly higher than desirable . However , none of the retailers report any plans for extra clearance sales in January or February .

In addition , labor disputes between residential builders and carpenters and between foundries and workers have been slowing down construction and manufacturing activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area . Financial Activity The sluggishness in the district 's economy is manifested in weak bank lending . Loans at Minneapolis-St. Paul area banks in June and July were essentially unchanged from their lackluster level this past spring . According to directors , bank lending outside the Twin Cities also continued to be weak .",-0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:55:29.4257039Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 2949, 23833, 1557, 2235, 1065, 4886, 23782, 1070, 1040, 7949, 9493, 1427, 6683, 1518, 13908, 1254, 24896, 1610, 1183, 7949, 1968, 1505, 1040, 2614, 1070, 1040, 3707, 1968, 1117, 21766, 26410, 6431, 1265, 1072, 2876, 5298, 29501, 5970, 2723, 1864, 1070, 1040, 3191, 9243, 1447, 17633, 1232, 12872, 1610, 1183, 7949, 1117, 1603, 2018, 20766, 1491, 11948, 1254, 3624, 1567, 8347, 14130, 1042, 1610, 5345, 5493, 29501, 29566, 3857, 1968, 29473, 29508, 29549, 29493, 29502, 29502, 29502, 4653, 1070, 18617, 8201, 1274, 1518, 1124, 12872, 1968, 17800, 2433, 4113, 1610, 1328, 5286, 1968, 8347, 14130, 1042, 2212, 19118, 2581, 1172, 1072, 2021, 22325, 1172, 1072, 2212, 2187, 2808, 1072, 8201, 1274, 1518, 4712, 1056, 1828, 7148, 1072, 15954, 7123, 1065, 1040, 3965, 1253, 21157, 29501, 1486, 29491, 4688, 2192, 22927, 3466, 1610, 17914, 24834, 1183, 1903, 23833, 1557, 2235, 1065, 1040, 7949, 1232, 29481, 9493, 1117, 11820, 1054, 1065, 7102, 5974, 1073, 3338, 1610, 8068, 1277, 1206, 3965, 1253, 21157, 29501, 1486, 29491, 4688, 3466, 14051, 1065, 4980, 1072, 5166, 1422, 14083, 1289, 12015, 1245, 1420, 6270, 29482, 4631, 2952, 1224, 3377, 8242, 1610, 7354, 1066, 23418, 1968, 5974, 1073, 3338, 4304, 1040, 1088, 5930, 1102, 1986, 1603, 6085, 1066, 1115, 7102, 1610, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 1155, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 2518976600, 'load_duration': 4946600, 'prompt_eval_count': 256, 'prompt_eval_duration': 795374000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1720108000}"

Home construction is about 30 percent of normal for this time of year . However , multiple-family building permits took an unexpected sharp increase in September .

Manufacturing Nearly all of the Eighth District manufacturers surveyed reported no significant change in production over the past month . Chemical , textile and clothing manufacturers reported the strongest sales , while production in building materials , electric motor , and household appliances remains sluggish . Manufacturers report changes in raw material prices over the last month ranging from -1.5 to +5.0 percent and indicate that current raw material prices are about 7-9 percent higher than a year ago .

In heavy equipment manufacturing , a construction equipment firm permanently closed a plant in Minnesota , and a North Dakota tractor manufacturer laid off 80 people . In consumer products manufacturing , an apparel firm permanently closed a plant in Minnesota , and a major microwave oven manufacturer recently shut down its South Dakota plant for three or four weeks . The metal mining and lumbering industries generally have continued to operate at low production levels . Minnesota 's largest taconite plant , shut down in June , was supposed to resume operations later this year .

It recently announced , however , that it will not reopen until `` sometime in 1983 .

222,"large iron mining company recalled about 1,800 workers in early March , another laid off 2,100 workers for eight weeks . Besides that , energy production , which had long been a source of strength for the district , weakened recently . Due to the glut in petroleum supplies , oil exploration slowed at the western end of the district . A Montana director said that in early March 100 oil rigs were idle in eastern Montana and western North Dakota . Directors also said that the forest products industry at both ends of the district remained very depressed . Agricultural Conditions Recent changes in the prices of farm products indicate possible recovery for about half the district 's farmers—those who produce livestock—but not for the other half . Between January and early March , the prices farmers receive for hogs and cattle at South St. Paul rose about 7 percent . One director attributed part of the rise to unusually harsh winter weather restricting the flow of livestock to market . But the price rise may not be as temporary as that explanation would indicate : an economist associated with the livestock industry attributed part of the rise to livestock herds being smaller than anticipated . Crop farmers have n't had to face this ambiguity about their price situation . Cash crop prices at Minneapolis were essentially unchanged between January and early March , and they were considerably below their year-earlier levels . Weak demand seemed to be keeping these prices down , for the",-0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:55:58.9770084Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 17730, 8843, 15889, 3264, 17599, 1452, 29473, 29508, 29493, 29551, 29502, 29502, 8201, 1065, 3703, 4885, 1968, 2466, 11303, 1573, 29473, 29518, 29493, 29508, 29502, 29502, 8201, 1122, 6203, 5355, 1610, 15630, 1137, 1968, 4176, 5653, 1968, 1458, 1321, 1811, 1518, 1032, 3600, 1070, 7110, 1122, 1040, 7949, 1968, 7102, 2874, 6683, 1610, 16811, 1066, 1040, 2040, 1097, 1065, 6176, 10374, 1151, 14447, 1968, 6271, 23851, 29404, 1206, 1040, 13540, 1716, 1070, 1040, 7949, 1610, 1098, 6452, 3006, 7627, 1541, 1137, 1065, 3703, 4885, 29473, 29508, 29502, 29502, 6271, 11304, 29481, 1422, 26050, 1065, 17263, 6452, 3006, 1072, 13540, 4732, 28034, 1610, 6823, 1502, 1603, 1541, 1137, 1040, 9381, 4844, 5547, 1206, 2328, 10443, 1070, 1040, 7949, 8336, 1983, 28464, 1610, 24605, 2658, 12652, 2833, 28495, 5203, 1065, 1040, 9274, 1070, 7122, 4844, 12402, 3340, 12874, 1122, 1452, 3563, 1040, 7949, 1232, 29481, 17898, 29589, 1130, 1413, 1461, 7840, 10446, 1142, 1397, 29589, 3159, 1227, 1122, 1040, 1567, 3563, 1610, 18814, 5392, 1072, 3703, 4885, 1968, 1040, 9274, 17898, 6324, 1122, 1063, 23758, 1072, 23905, 1206, 4426, 1430, 29491, 4688, 9304, 1452, 29473, 29555, 4921, 1610, 3155, 7627, 26901, 1512, 1070, 1040, 9186, 1066, 13217, 2091, 18906, 9307, 8854, 9104, 1056, 1040, 5467, 1070, 10446, 1142, 1397, 1066, 3436, 1610, 1860, 1040, 4912, 9186, 1761, 1227, 1115, 1158, 14183, 1158, 1137, 14036, 1450, 12402, 1482, 1164, 4388, 1160, 6131, 1163, 1040, 10446, 1142, 1397, 5547, 26901, 1512, 1070, 1040, 9186, 1066, 10446, 1142, 1397, 1327, 4441, 2018, 7768, 1589, 25792, 1610, 1102, 2274, 17898, 1274, 1075, 29510, 29475, 1321, 1066, 2873, 1224, 26555, 26007, 1452, 1420, 4912, 5388, 1610, 24207, 22716, 9274, 1206, 3965, 1253, 21157, 1422, 14083, 1289, 12015, 2212, 5392, 1072, 3703, 4885, 1968, 1072, 1358, 1422, 25781, 4392, 1420, 1647, 29501, 1412, 29482, 1517, 6925, 1610, 1584, 1259, 6405, 4361, 1066, 1115, 8371, 1935, 9274, 1828, 1968, 1122, 1040, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 1155, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 2756852800, 'load_duration': 6675600, 'prompt_eval_count': 365, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1001560000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1749338000}"
223,"December 15 , 1982 Overview Economic activity in most Districts showed some signs of improvement except in the manufacturing sector . Weakness in manufacturing remained pervasive with some further layoffs reported and , for the most part , little or no upturn in new orders . Consumer spending strengthened in November but several Districts noted sluggish early-December sales . Housing sales and starts registered gains in most regions although the oversupply of office space kept nonresidential construction generally slow . In several agricultural areas a further decline in farm income and land values overshadowed the few bright spots that appeared . Commercial bank lending was essentially flat in most reporting Districts . The general outlook ranges from a slight upturn during the next six months to little pickup until late 1983 . Consumer Spending Since the last report , consumer expenditures posted some gains on both a month-to-month and year-over-year basis , helped in part by promotional activity . Nonetheless , no real exuberance was displayed . Auto sales picked up in several areas in response to lower finance charges but these lower rates are scheduled to end soon . With regard to the overall outlook for retail sales during the holiday season , the most optimistic report was from Boston ( `` solid but unspectacular '' ) .

Business liquidity continues to deteriorate ; profits will remain under extreme pressure , while no balance sheet restructuring has materialized during this recession . Many additional downgradings of business credit ratings are likely to be announced in the forthcoming months . Interest rates will continue to be highly volatile . The long-term bond markets in particular will be challenged by a lack of liquidity in business , the huge Treasury cash needs , and a firm monetary policy . Maude : Most likely developments over the spring and early summer months should place renewed severe upward pressure on interest rates with long-term yields retesting their 1981 highs in a financial crisis type environment . These developments should manifest themselves in the form of a highly anemic economic recovery , some modest pick-up in private credit demands , a cash flow squeeze in the nonfinancial corporate sector , continued strains on financial intermediaries , credit quality concerns and a reluctance on the part of investors to make long-term fixed income commitments . The underlying causes of these difficulties should be an April and July surge in money growth , a resulting monetary tightening , huge actual Treasury financing ( especially during the third quarter ) and continued apprehension over the out-year budgetary deficits .

231,"August and , with 2 1/2-year small savers certificates , accounted for most of the growth in savings capital at S & Ls . Time deposits and jumbo CDs contributed the largest shares to September 's deposit gains at banks . In contrast , loan activity at large southeastern banks slowed significantly in September after advancing throughout the summer . Business lending , which failed to register a gain from August to September , was the primary source of this deceleration . However , consumer lending increased in September for the seventh consecutive month . A money center bank is backing Florida legislation to allow out-of- state financial institutions to establish de novo operations in the state , thereby permitting out-of-state banks to enter the market without acquiring existing institutions . The proposal is a response to a legislative initiative by Florida bankers to limit out-of-state banking to institutions from regional states with similar reciprocal agreements . Tourism The industry is entering its traditionally slow fall season after a summer that proved to be generally positive , except in south Florida , middle and east Tennessee , and New Orleans . Hotels and motels increased revenues in August even though occupancy levels were below comparable 1982 levels in many District cities . Hotel construction in central Florida and the apparently rapid absorption of expensive resort properties along Florida 's north Atlantic coast augur continued growth in these areas .

Finance Legislators in Florida and Tennessee have effectively defeated bills to allow interstate banking in their respective states . Proponents of the Florida legislation maintained that interstate banking would provide more capital for loans , expand the state 's tax base , and create some healthy competition . Although tabled , the Florida bill could come up later this year . Advocates of the Tennessee legislation argued that out-of-state acquisition of some local banks would relieve the lack of confidence in the state 's financial industry caused by the failure of United American Bank ( UAB ) . Bankers claim the FDIC 's failure to honor loan participations purchased by Tennessee and Kentucky banks from the now defunct UAB could further weaken some already shaken institutions .

The square footage of nonresidential projects showed surprising strength in the first quarter . This sector is expected to remain healthy all year . The availability of materials for homebuilding is mixed . There is plenty of lumber , plywood , and particle board , but sheetrock and exterior siding are in short supply .

Because of rising demand from homebuilders and steady demand from commercial construction , suppliers may have to ration sheetrock until the third quarter , when new production capacity will come on line .

243,"February 2 , 1983 Overview Business firms in the Tenth District are expecting a slow recovery to get underway during the second or third quarter of 1983 . Recent stable prices are expected to rise slightly as 1983 moves along . Inventories are generally lean and are likely to remain so in the near future . Farmers and agricultural lenders are somewhat more optimistic about conditions in the agricultural sector , due partly to the expected response to the newly announced farm program . Loan demand at commercial banks is generally flat , while deposit growth is up because of strong growth in the new money market deposit accounts . Retail Trade All respondents indicate that nominal sales for 1982 as a whole were slightly higher ( 5 percent or less ) than those in 1981 . Sales in the final quarter of 1982 were between 5 and 10 percent higher than a year earlier . The strength in retail sales has come mainly in soft goods , with big-ticket items still very weak .

Current reports on business loan volume range from 11 percent below to 14 percent above a year ago , much the same as they were six weeks ago . According to contacts , increased corporate profits have sufficiently improved cash flow at many companies , permitting more internal financing and preventing any real firming of commercial loan demand . Loan activity on the retail side continues to improve , but recent gains are not as strong as earlier in the year . Although consumer lending is now as much as 11 percent ahead of last September , lenders say rising interest rates have taken some of the edge off the demand for consumer loans . Area banking officials foresee gradual improvement in overall lending activity over the next six months . C & I loan demand is expected to gain strength slowly through next March as commercial investment expands beyond the funds available internally . Most bankers also predict that consumer demand for credit will expand further despite the likelihood of slightly higher interest rates . Many lenders plan to maintain their aggressive marketing posture . The prime rate charged by major Third District banks has risen to 11 percent in September from 10.5 percent in early August . Local seers are predicting that , because of positive reports on inflation and the money supply , upward movement in interest rates over the next six months will remain sluggish ..

Corn , soybeans , tobacco , alfalfa , cotton , fruits and vegetables were all hurt , and many chickens and some hogs died . Financial losses to many individual farmers and rural communities have been severe . Meat and other food prices are likely to rise over the next year because of the reduced supplies . The lower yields , reinforcing the PIK program acreage cuts , are reducing the large overhang of inventories . Commodity prices have risen , bolstering total farm income .

Employment levels are rising for most firms , although one respondent foresees a large layoff in one division . Several manufacturers noted that they are producing more output with fewer people than in the past . Price increases seem to be more frequent . Most firms say they see more increases in the prices of purchased materials and components . Paper , steel and aluminum were mentioned . Several of the firms contacted have recently increased their own prices . Nevertheless , manufacturers are still very cautious about raising prices and will back off if the increase meets a lot of resistance . According to an automotive supplier , the auto companies are negotiating long-term contracts with price decreases in the first year and very modest increases thereafter . One respondent expressed concern that the wage settlement to be negotiated between GM and the UAW in 1984 will be very large and will set a pattern for other industries . Mortgage Lending Mortgage lending by thrift institutions declined in the fourth quarter but remained far above the level in the fourth quarter of 1982 . Loan repayments appear to have exceeded loans made in the fourth quarter , but for the entire year loans were ahead of repayments .

251,"December 5 , 1984 Summary Total business activity in the Seventh District has been about stable since early this year , having flattened earlier than in the nation . Most District reports suggest relative stability in the months ahead , but concern has been growing that a general deterioration is underway . Auto production has returned to a high level , but only slightly above last year . Steel output has improved since late September , but remains well below the first half rate , and below break-even levels . Machine tool orders are up , mainly from the auto industry . Heavy construction and farm equipment makers , faced with weak markets , are selling off units and closing marginal plants . Cutbacks are occurring in the important health care industry , reversing a long-term expansion . Container loadings on flat cars , which had slowed earlier in the year , slipped significantly in November . Demand for most mechanical capital equipment remains weak . Sales of heavy trucks and trailers have softened recently from high levels . However , surveys show sizable additions to capital outlays next year by the auto and steel industries . Many lines of seasonal retail merchandise are reported moving well , but the 2-year boom in consumer hardgoods apparently has run its course . Retail inventories are viewed as excessive , encouraging price markdowns . Recent declines in paperboard demand partly reflect reduced orders for general merchandise .

Residential construction continues to weaken , while nonresidential construction is expanding",0.3,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:57:24.8903395Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 4105, 5122, 29473, 29550, 1968, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29551, 29549, 24044, 11479, 2723, 7123, 1065, 1040, 1086, 3651, 29484, 8975, 1427, 1518, 1452, 12079, 2622, 3703, 1224, 1647, 1968, 3229, 1740, 1829, 2874, 6353, 1589, 1065, 1040, 6646, 1610, 5590, 8975, 8727, 4165, 8754, 16905, 1065, 1040, 4138, 7048, 1968, 1330, 5136, 1427, 1518, 7253, 1137, 1032, 3720, 19979, 2550, 1120, 1117, 1684, 1896, 1610, 12959, 5653, 1427, 5021, 1066, 1032, 2254, 2952, 1968, 1330, 1633, 7959, 3515, 2200, 1647, 1610, 16642, 4593, 1427, 12725, 2622, 4677, 4842, 1968, 1330, 8288, 1930, 4392, 1040, 1675, 3563, 5106, 1968, 1072, 4392, 2489, 29501, 9558, 6925, 1610, 14021, 4689, 9404, 1228, 1350, 1968, 12232, 1245, 1040, 4795, 5547, 1610, 28196, 7148, 1072, 7122, 7876, 1058, 9542, 1968, 13333, 1163, 7102, 12342, 1968, 1228, 10926, 1573, 8775, 1072, 13752, 26054, 10691, 1610, 19282, 19844, 1228, 29033, 1065, 1040, 3046, 3296, 2424, 5547, 1968, 17644, 1056, 1032, 1811, 29501, 7358, 11888, 1610, 25972, 4210, 1510, 1124, 7775, 9068, 1968, 1458, 1321, 29404, 6353, 1065, 1040, 1647, 1968, 16609, 11885, 1065, 5117, 1610, 5035, 1159, 1122, 1848, 19600, 6333, 7876, 8288, 7102, 1610, 17145, 1070, 6685, 23756, 1072, 8773, 1172, 1274, 3432, 2874, 6683, 1245, 2254, 6925, 1610, 3761, 1968, 29022, 2115, 1036, 12320, 1735, 2833, 1066, 6333, 1343, 29482, 1516, 2447, 1647, 1254, 1040, 4795, 1072, 10213, 18677, 1610, 6793, 5483, 1070, 4070, 1050, 12371, 19492, 1159, 1632, 1228, 6513, 6040, 1930, 1968, 1330, 1040, 29473, 29518, 29501, 5163, 25925, 1065, 12845, 2624, 13452, 29481, 11364, 1427, 2250, 1639, 3131, 1610, 9105, 1382, 9950, 3188, 1228, 17629, 1158, 24981, 1968, 22653, 4912, 2484, 4022, 29481, 1610, 28495, 4568, 2071, 1065, 4598, 4284, 6405, 19976, 8735, 10165, 9404, 1122, 3720, 19492, 1159, 1632, 1610, 781, 781, 1914, 28125, 7148, 11120, 1066, 1246, 3357, 1968, 2080, 2611, 1179, 28125, 7148, 1117, 21535, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29538, 29520], 'total_duration': 2759446600, 'load_duration': 4968200, 'prompt_eval_count': 359, 'prompt_eval_duration': 978406000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1774272000}"
252,". District farmers , many in distress because of heavy debts and weak prices , continue to restrict purchases . Recession Fears The plateau in District activity since last spring , coupled with recent declines in factory orders and freight movements , raises the question of an imminent recession . Pressures to reduce or hold down inventories are intense . Our contacts with industries important in the District generally expect relative stability during the rest of 1984 and early 1985—but no precipitous decline . However , some company analysts are warning their managements that the situation is fragile and that a general decline , rather than renewed expansion , is the more likely development . Motor Vehicles Auto makers are planning production at a high level through next year 's first quarter , but with only small gains from year-earlier levels . Weaker auto sales in recent months reflect shortages of popular models . Strikes , unrelated parts shortages , and import quotas have limited supplies .

Executives say these moves were necessitated by growing competition from food discounters . Cuts in labor costs have been reflected in lower food prices .

Sales of appliances , led by microwaves , have been `` phenomenal '' . Other hard goods also have done well . Inventories , overall , are now slightly higher than had been budgeted , especially when goods on order are included , but not a cause of concern .

Farm equipment remains very weak . Light construction equipment has improved , but not heavy types . Freight car orders are somewhat higher , but only specialized types , including piggy-back flatcars , auto carriers , and some bulk carriers .

Employment Improved job markets in the District are still largely a result of callbacks in manufacturing . Rehires by motor vehicle and parts plants are by far the most important , but there have also been gains in appliances , mobile homes , and recreational vehicles . Residential construction is also up . In November , all District states , with Michigan far in the lead , reported good gains in factory employment from late 1982. but the shortfall from late 1978 still ranged from 15 percent in Wisconsin to 20 percent in Iowa , and 24 percent in Illinois , Indiana , and Michigan . Total non- manufacturing employment data show no improvement through November . State and local governments , public utilities , and financial institutions are generally hiring only to fill essential vacancies , and many are reducing staff .

255,"October 23 , 1984 Overview Some moderation continues to be apparent in Tenth District economic activity . While retail sales continue to improve , housing activity and mortgage demand have generally slowed . Inventories of retail goods are slightly larger than desired , while inventories of materials inputs are at satisfactory levels . Price increases have been small , and are expected to continue so . Loan demand is increasing slightly at district banks , while deposits remain unchanged . Yields of fall-harvested crops varied across the district while the newly-planted winter wheat crop is in good condition . Retail Trade Retailers report that year-to-date retail sales are up significantly over a year ago , and that sales continued to improve in the past three months . Inventories are slightly larger than desired for some retailers . However , no major trimming is intended , because most retailers are optimistic about sales through the remainder of the year . Prices remained generally flat in recent months , and no significant increases are anticipated through the remainder of the year . Automobile Sales Automobile dealers throughout the Tenth District continue to report improved sales in 1984 relative to last year . Credit market conditions are satisfactory , and financing is available both for floorplanning and car buyers .

This represented the largest monthly increase in 1984 and offset weakness in commercial and real estate lending . A sample of smaller institutions showed similar behavior . These increases continue the pattern of strong consumer loan growth shown earlier this year . Bankers in the region attribute the strength to improved economic conditions which have boosted consumer purchases of new cars and recreational vehicles . While a number of banks also report strength in home equity loans , others have experienced slow to flat demand for those loans as consumers have shifted to use of personal credit lines and credit cards for financing . The forecast for consumer credit remains mixed . Many banks expect these loans to continue to grow rapidly through year-end . However , an even larger number of institutions expect slower growth in personal income and rising interest rates to cause a slowdown in both consumer spending and borrowing . A few of these already have experienced a falloff in consumer loan demand .",0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:57:50.3822257Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 18732, 1072, 1615, 2516, 1032, 1729, 1233, 1065, 1040, 4420, 6849, 20192, 1030, 11277, 3466, 1070, 7015, 1610, 17914, 21697, 1362, 1328, 4396, 1968, 12845, 6951, 1093, 1227, 4070, 1346, 22643, 1911, 1206, 3243, 14051, 1065, 1040, 6620, 1367, 1130, 8975, 8876, 1206, 1032, 29473, 29518, 29549, 4921, 10326, 5106, 1610, 1619, 11251, 1040, 8407, 15658, 6015, 1065, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29551, 29549, 1072, 5238, 19056, 1065, 8148, 1072, 2121, 10258, 1073, 3338, 1610, 1098, 8092, 1070, 7768, 13406, 7410, 4452, 6942, 1610, 3725, 12863, 4456, 1040, 6108, 1070, 3735, 12845, 10744, 6825, 5662, 6353, 1224, 1647, 1610, 8606, 1172, 1065, 1040, 5192, 7604, 1040, 7110, 1066, 12725, 7406, 5099, 1458, 1274, 11742, 1054, 12845, 26364, 1070, 1401, 9068, 1072, 1705, 1035, 2017, 12767, 1610, 4791, 1032, 2242, 1070, 14051, 1603, 3032, 7110, 1065, 2379, 23619, 16324, 1968, 3431, 1274, 9072, 4712, 1066, 7775, 6405, 1122, 2163, 16324, 1158, 14544, 1274, 17386, 1066, 1706, 1070, 4095, 6951, 5483, 1072, 6951, 9213, 1122, 28206, 1610, 1183, 20680, 1122, 12845, 6951, 8288, 10198, 1610, 6793, 14051, 2443, 1935, 16324, 1066, 4456, 1066, 3101, 14867, 1827, 1647, 29501, 1184, 1610, 3761, 1968, 1164, 1787, 6852, 2242, 1070, 13406, 2443, 26410, 6825, 1065, 4095, 8672, 1072, 12630, 2913, 8746, 1066, 5012, 1032, 4712, 4022, 1065, 2328, 12845, 10749, 1072, 14987, 1056, 1610, 1098, 2432, 1070, 1935, 2909, 1274, 9072, 1032, 3717, 2537, 1065, 12845, 10744, 6405, 1610, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 2594911900, 'load_duration': 5082000, 'prompt_eval_count': 286, 'prompt_eval_duration': 824901000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1765770000}"
259,"October 23 , 1984 Consumer spending continued at a brisk pace during September and early October in the Eighth District , but home sales were down and most other sectors of the economy experienced little change . Expectations by most respondents are that consumer spending will remain strong for the remainder of the year and that manufacturing , transportation and employment will rise moderately , while construction is likely to drift lower . Consumer Spending The greatest strength in District economic activity during September and early October was in retail sales . At six department stores , sales were 8 percent higher than the comparable period a year ago , which was then considered a relatively good sales period . Better quality apparel , sports wear , cosmetics and consumer electronics moved particularly well , while sales of furniture and carpeting were below year-ago levels . At each of three discount stores , sales increases were more than 14 percent above the year-ago pace . Promotions combined with price markdowns were successful in moving merchandise . Auto demand remained strong in most parts of the District during September and early October . In the last week of September , however , sales became somewhat sluggish . Seven dealers reported sales 11 percent higher in September than in the same month a year ago , and early October was nearly as good .

Reflecting the strong demand and a continued shortage of popular models , effective new car prices increased at the retail level .

264,"May 6 , 1985 Economic activity has slowed in the First District in recent months . The slowdown has occurred in both the manufacturing and retail sectors , but some individual firms continue to show substantial growth . Retailers ' sales fell below plan in some cases but continue to exceed last year 's levels . In manufacturing , the national slowdown in office equipment and computers has been well publicized , and New England 's high tech firms have been among those experiencing difficulty . The region 's traditional industries report mixed results , but remain optimistic about 1985 . Retail Retail sales have slowed recently in the First District . The weakening is not universal , however , hitting some `` upscale '' department stores for example , but not a discount chain , and showing wide geographic variation . The downturn is not substantial , and merchants remain moderately optimistic about 1985 . The shift of Easter from April last year to March this year complicates the interpretation of spring sales figures , but March was not an exceptional month for New England retailers . Apparel and other soft goods—traditional Easter items—sold well during the month , but sales in other areas , including home products , pets and sporting goods were disappointing . Early signs suggest that April is following the March trend , and without Easter the measured increases against April last year will be very small or negative .

265,"January 30 , 1985 The expansion appears to have resumed in the First District . Retailers experienced reasonably satisfactory year-over-year increases in Christmas sales , although promotional activity reduced margins . Retail inventories are a little higher than desired . In the manufacturing sector , recent order experience varies considerably , with some firms reporting order increases , others flat order rates and a few decreases . However , all the manufacturers contacted have projected significant real gains in 1985 . Manufacturing inventories are in line with sales , based on past experience ; but several contacts are not satisfied with this performance and are pushing to lower inventory-to-sales ratios . There is no evidence of any pickup in inflation ; recent price increases have been very modest and price expectations for 1985 seem to have moderated . Mortgage rates have been gradually falling for several months . Retailing Stores in the First District reported respectable but not spectacular sales increases over the preceding year in December and early January . Promotional activity reduced margins and inventories are somewhat above plan . Most merchants expressed optimism about sales growth in 1985 . Sales increases among the retailers contacted ranged from 6 to 10 percent above December 1983 . The recent year-over-year increases are generally smaller than those recorded earlier in 1984 , but most stores expected this because 1983 finished so strongly .

Contacts with affiliates or branches in other parts of the country said New England stores showed the best performance .

266,"July bringing new orders for the first half above last year 's first half . Builders anticipate that the second half will be equally strong . However , there is little speculative building , as builders remain cautious and uncertain about how long the current uptrend will last . Real estate firms had an exceptional second quarter . The volume of contract closings at one realty firm was the highest in two years , and its forecast for closings in the second half has been revised upward , but the firm will remain in a wait-and-see posture until August before deciding whether to increase its staff . More move-up buyers are reentering housing markets . Mortgage lending volume is picking up with the 15-year mortgage becoming popular and the adjustable rate mortgage losing favor among borrowers . In the second half of the year , mortgage markets in Ohio will receive a boost from recently approved state-subsidized mortgage money that amounts to $ 346 million and that will be available to qualifying home buyers at 9.8 percent . Commercial Banking District loan demand continues to be mixed . Loans outstanding in all major categories at large banks increased over the past month .

Consumer Spending Large retailers or general merchandise in the Twin Cities report that business has been good . Two large district chain operations had better-than-expected performance in the first quarter , which appears to have continued into April . Major retailers in bustling Sioux Falls , South Dakota , report brisk business , attributed primarily to price reductions and aggressive advertising . But Bank directors note that business has slowed in southern Minnesota and has continued to lag throughout the agriculturally dependent parts of this district . A similar story is told for auto sales which have continued strong in diversified metro areas but have been generally weak in rural areas . Domestic manufacturers report that their sales , when compared to 1984 , increased 9 percent through April . Slack demand in nonmetro areas has bogged down truck sales somewhat , though . Housing activity is also still slack in rural areas , but sales of homes in the Twin Cities have improved . Sales in both Minneapolis and St. Paul have been well above 1984 levels -- by more than 12 percent this February , for example .

270,"Beige Book Report : Minneapolis May 6 , 1985 While overall employment and consumer spending have recently increased in the Ninth District , agricultural and resource-related weaknesses have continued . Some signs of slower manufacturing growth are also evident . Employment District labor market conditions have continued to improve , regularly in the service sectors . Spurred by larger-than-usual quarterly employment growth , the district 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell a few tenths to 6.3 percent in the first quarter . Indicative of this improvement , Minnesota 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent in March , its lowest since August 1981 . Also in March , nonfarm employment reached a record high in Minnesota . Employment growth has been particularly evident in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area , which at the end of last year ranked fifth fastest in employment growth among large metro areas . Strong labor demand is present in Minneapolis , where the help-wanted advertising index was recently 11 percent above its year-earlier level . The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate also appears to have fallen in Montana , dropping from 7.6 percent in January to a probable 7 percent in March . Recent labor developments have been mixed . Layoffs at a conglomerate with plants in the Twin Cities and Sioux Falls , South Dakota , continued . As a result , the latter area 's unemployment rate rose measurably .

The end of large construction projects decreased employment in parts of North Dakota .

271,"December 5 , 1985 Overview The economy appears to be growing slowly at best . Only Richmond describes its District economy as strong , although there is some optimism in the reports from Philadelphia and New York . Retail sales gains are uneven , and less-than-robust Christmas sales are expected . Auto sales are low now that special interest rate incentives have largely ended . Industrial activity continues quite sluggish with few gains yet from dollar depreciation . Residential construction is improving but non-residential construction is uneven . Agricultural prices remain weak despite some rises in meat prices ; agricultural land prices continue to fall and farm finances remain weak . Commercial bank consumer and real estate lending is rising further but business lending is declining in most Districts . Retail Sales October retail sales other than autos are mind , with most Districts reporting moderate year-over-year gains . Sales are frequently described as strong for apparel and weak for various hardgoods . Inventories are generally at desired levels and are being built cautiously as most retailers expect Christmas sales to show only moderate increases from 1984 . New car sales continue to run well below year-ago levels in most Districts in reaction to the end of most special financing . However , Richmond and Dallas report sales were stronger than usual in October . Manufacturing and Mining Industrial activity continues to be quite sluggish .

There is little indication in the District reports that dollar depreciation has resulted in higher prices or stronger demand for",-0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:58:33.0911956Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 4105, 5122, 29473, 29550, 1968, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29551, 29550, 6003, 2346, 1183, 9493, 8813, 1066, 1115, 7253, 7928, 1206, 2257, 1610, 7120, 26950, 14734, 1639, 8975, 9493, 1158, 3735, 1968, 6200, 1504, 1117, 1509, 7765, 2211, 1065, 1040, 8727, 1245, 16572, 1072, 2218, 3494, 1610, 9105, 1382, 7060, 22490, 1228, 2987, 2202, 1968, 1072, 2876, 29501, 23786, 29501, 19211, 1237, 8184, 7060, 1228, 4117, 1610, 12959, 7060, 1228, 3627, 1823, 1137, 3609, 2913, 5106, 20721, 2539, 1274, 13050, 7822, 1610, 23070, 7123, 11120, 4216, 1903, 23833, 1557, 1163, 2432, 22490, 3551, 1245, 17764, 1108, 2547, 1957, 1120, 1610, 2760, 28125, 7148, 1117, 17520, 1330, 2611, 29501, 1179, 28125, 7148, 1117, 2987, 2202, 1610, 24605, 2658, 9274, 7112, 7102, 8345, 1509, 1176, 4668, 1065, 10996, 9274, 3521, 23583, 3301, 9274, 4456, 1066, 3717, 1072, 7122, 1622, 3001, 7112, 7102, 1610, 25319, 5974, 12845, 1072, 2121, 10258, 1073, 3338, 1117, 12630, 4397, 1330, 2723, 1073, 3338, 1117, 4568, 4806, 1065, 1848, 8975, 29481, 1610, 9105, 1382, 17145, 5295, 12371, 7060, 1567, 1589, 1974, 1153, 1228, 3041, 1968, 1163, 1848, 8975, 29481, 15206, 23419, 1647, 29501, 2251, 29501, 5163, 22490, 1610, 17145, 1228, 11988, 6165, 1158, 3735, 1122, 1722, 24872, 1072, 7102, 1122, 4886, 2624, 13452, 29481, 1610, 1328, 1839, 3188, 1228, 7509, 1206, 12553, 6925, 1072, 1228, 2018, 5197, 14599, 8758, 1158, 1848, 12371, 1172, 2443, 8184, 7060, 1066, 2115, 1633, 23419, 12863, 1245, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29551, 29549, 1610, 2218, 2021, 7060, 4456, 1066, 2250, 1930, 4392, 1647, 29501, 5335, 6925, 1065, 1848, 8975, 29481, 1065, 11053, 1066, 1040, 1716, 1070, 1848, 3609, 28206, 1610, 3761, 1968, 26950, 1072, 19809, 3032, 7060, 1422, 13542, 1589, 9202, 1065, 5295, 1610, 20431, 2146, 1072, 3965, 1056, 23070, 7123, 11120, 1066, 1115, 4216, 1903, 23833, 1557, 1610, 781, 781, 6584, 1117, 2396, 24951, 1065, 1040, 8975, 8727, 1137, 17764, 1108, 2547, 1957, 1120, 1427, 17728, 1065, 5105, 9274, 1210, 13542, 6405, 1122, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 1155, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 2759876300, 'load_duration': 5042000, 'prompt_eval_count': 372, 'prompt_eval_duration': 988219000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1763697000}"

Residential sales are strong in most areas , spurred by stable mortgage rates at just over 12 percent , rising incomes , and the availability of subsidized mortgage money in some states . House prices are reported to be firm and new listings strong . Nonresidential construction is generally weaker than residential building , but still healthy in many regions . There is some evidence that new construction may be slowing slightly , but projects already underway should provide continued strength . Many observers are surprised that nonresidential construction has not already lost steam , in view of rising vacancy rates and a general feeling that the office market is already overbuilt . Chicago notes that some projects have been started recently so that they will be grandfathered under the current tax code and thereby protected from future tax changes . Office leasing activity is mixed , with vacancy rates at suburban locations generally higher than in downtown areas . As a result , rents in suburban areas may hold steady or even fall in coming months . Agriculture While livestock farmers have gotten some measure of relief recently from higher livestock prices , crop farmers remain in financial stress in many areas , and may find their plight worsening . Harvests currently underway are likely to yield bumper crops that will drive farm prices and revenues even lower .

This is indicated in key words and phrases in district summaries : Boston , `` retail sales improving , manufacturing in the doldrums '' ; New York , `` little growth '' ; Philadelphia , `` same as August '' ; Cleveland , `` soft and uneven '' ; Richmond , no `` broadbased improvement '' ; Atlanta , `` healthy on balance '' ; Chicago , `` no overall pickup or weakening '' ; St. Louis , `` continues to lag '' ; Minneapolis , `` a bit weaker '' ; Kansas City and Dallas , `` sluggish '' ; and San Francisco , '' signals are mixed '' . Among economic sectors , however , there are significant variations . Perhaps the most troubled sector , at present , is agriculture , with prices and income severely depressed . Total employment is growing moderately , but with great variation by region . Manufacturing output , overall , is about stable . Mining , including oil and gas development , is depressed . Retail sales are somewhat stronger , but mainly disappointing . Auto sales have been stimulated by special financing . Inventories are in fairly good balance , and all types of goods readily available .

274,"December 5 , 1985 Overview Moat reports from around the Fifth District suggest that economic and business activity remains quite strong . Seasonal factors are causing some churning of employment activity , and special factors much as the end of the automobile financing opportunities of late summer and early fall are also causing some confusion . Nonetheless , employment , retail sales , construction , and housing sales are all reported , on balance , to be holding at quite high levels . Retail sales seem to be running well ahead of national trends , with experience varying significantly across product lines and regions . District employment has drawn recent support from construction , government , and to a lesser extent from manufacturing , sufficient to offset seasonal losses in agriculture related areas and tourism services . Manufacturing Manufacturing activity in the District , after leveling out in the past few months , is showing some signs of trying to bounce off of the bottom reached last summer . Several District states have experienced manufacturing employment gains lately , and even where employment shows continued weakness , average weekly hours of production workers has tuned up sharply .

Some pickup in textile and apparel exports has developed of late providing some support for these industries , while in the furniture group , strong retail sales are beginning to",0.7,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:58:41.0316833Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.7}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 4105, 5122, 29473, 29550, 1968, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29551, 29550, 6003, 2346, 7653, 1038, 8727, 1245, 2169, 1040, 24127, 8975, 4165, 1137, 7406, 1072, 2723, 7123, 8288, 4216, 3735, 1610, 17655, 1050, 9380, 1228, 13866, 1509, 1252, 1221, 1056, 1070, 14855, 7123, 1968, 1072, 3609, 9380, 1956, 1158, 1040, 1716, 1070, 1040, 5375, 5182, 28206, 9580, 1070, 4677, 6329, 1072, 3703, 3717, 1228, 1603, 13866, 1509, 17398, 1610, 9955, 19927, 1968, 14855, 1968, 12371, 7060, 1968, 7148, 1968, 1072, 12589, 7060, 1228, 1312, 6513, 1968, 1124, 8641, 1968, 1066, 1115, 7400, 1206, 4216, 2254, 6925, 1610, 9105, 1382, 7060, 2477, 1066, 1115, 4590, 1930, 7048, 1070, 5050, 18637, 1968, 1163, 3427, 23080, 11885, 3441, 2861, 5483, 1072, 11310, 1610, 8975, 14855, 1427, 11189, 6159, 2528, 1245, 7148, 1968, 3826, 1968, 1072, 1066, 1032, 27535, 11893, 1245, 15954, 1968, 10174, 1066, 5238, 4070, 1050, 17043, 1065, 25611, 5970, 5788, 1072, 4652, 2211, 4113, 1610, 20431, 2146, 20431, 2146, 7123, 1065, 1040, 8975, 1968, 1792, 2952, 1056, 1343, 1065, 1040, 3377, 2432, 4138, 1968, 1117, 8870, 1509, 10858, 1070, 3710, 1066, 1055, 11586, 1573, 1070, 1040, 6627, 5816, 2200, 6329, 1610, 15991, 8975, 5373, 1274, 9072, 15954, 14855, 22490, 23396, 1968, 1072, 1787, 1738, 14855, 5138, 6085, 19056, 1968, 5919, 17264, 4084, 1070, 5653, 8201, 1427, 15781, 1054, 1350, 26770, 1610, 1183, 24444, 22490, 12779, 1065, 1040, 3013, 1314, 1968, 1722, 24872, 1968, 1072, 13157, 18677, 1032, 2870, 4352, 1228, 2018, 4104, 1968, 1072, 1065, 1509, 5237, 1787, 5197, 4482, 1610, 781, 781, 12368, 3856, 1483, 1065, 3013, 1314, 1072, 1722, 24872, 11447, 1427, 6970, 1070, 4677, 8269, 1509, 2528, 1122, 1935, 18677, 1968, 2080, 1065, 1040, 13157, 2839, 1968, 3735, 12371, 7060, 1228, 6166, 1066, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29555, 29520], 'total_duration': 2556946300, 'load_duration': 2151000, 'prompt_eval_count': 337, 'prompt_eval_duration': 894433000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1653262000}"
275,"August 6 , 1985 Overview Business and economic conditions in the Fifth District continue to reflect somewhat disparate performance across sectors . On balance , activity seems flat to rising slightly . Some of the areas of earlier strength continue to lend support , while others , notably the retail sector , have softened markedly . Construction activity and house sales remain upbeat . Manufacturing is flat to down slightly , although there is some indication that the slide in manufacturing employment has been arrested . Coal production remains below year earlier , although stocks have been drawn down significantly since year-end . The service sector remains the primary source of employment growth . The outlook fur agriculture has improved somewhat of late because of much improved weather conditions . Manufacturing There is little evidence of any significant turnaround in the manufacturing sector despite a modestly improved employment situation . According to our reports , manufacturing shipments stabilized over the past month , although new orders and order backlogs both declined . Month to month changes continue to be dominated by such sectors as textiles , apparel , and furniture where imports continue to gain market share . Some of this weakness has been offset recently by very modest gains in primary and fabricated metals , food products , and segments of the chemicals industry .

Coal production continues to run slightly below year ago levels , but recent employment losses appear to have been stemmed in this industry as well .

However , pressure on costs is sufficiently severe that production increases do not result necessarily in more jobs . Mining sectors remain weak , with low prices and reduced employment in petroleum . With the exception of major gold mining and refining operations which have realized recent strength , there is no sign of improvement in the beleaguered mineral mining sector . Construction and Real Estate In general , building has been strong , although high vacancy rates in commercial and residential property in most parts of the district portend reduced construction activity in the future .

In the three-month period ending in February , however , the 10.7 percent growth rate of District nonagricultural employment exceeded the nation 's 3.6 percent rate . District manufacturing employment increased at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months ending in February compared with a 2.1 percent rate for the nation . Despite these strong employment figures , even faster growth in the labor force raised the Eighth District unemployment rate in February from 7.7 to 8.0 percent .

Consumer Spending District retail sales growth continues to exceed the national pace . January sales in the region were 10.9 percent above year-ago levels while nationally sales increased by 6.2",0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:59:13.1715757Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 8917, 29473, 29552, 1968, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29551, 29552, 24044, 1183, 1181, 16958, 8975, 4841, 3885, 1070, 2121, 7406, 7123, 1422, 5105, 1589, 5050, 11157, 1522, 1040, 1848, 6159, 3984, 1610, 17558, 8931, 1070, 2328, 12050, 29501, 1072, 4113, 29501, 8077, 5437, 18677, 19514, 1066, 15813, 14855, 6825, 1065, 6159, 4138, 1610, 9105, 1382, 7060, 1274, 1518, 3735, 1224, 1647, 1163, 6825, 1915, 4887, 1056, 1137, 1070, 1040, 6646, 1610, 2760, 20339, 1556, 2443, 18990, 2560, 1030, 7929, 1066, 1972, 1065, 8251, 13529, 1290, 8672, 1137, 1761, 11742, 4205, 12845, 10749, 1610, 2438, 1092, 1661, 1254, 17351, 8854, 1065, 1040, 5192, 1968, 7148, 7123, 1065, 1040, 1675, 9017, 1603, 13204, 1054, 5050, 11157, 1610, 17914, 1072, 23583, 4841, 3885, 1228, 2876, 22653, 1968, 1163, 8148, 1072, 12845, 1073, 3338, 4712, 1056, 1065, 1040, 1675, 9017, 1072, 1476, 3036, 1065, 1040, 20680, 1070, 3627, 9274, 1122, 8975, 7122, 4844, 1610, 3697, 9897, 1181, 16958, 8975, 2611, 1125, 2259, 13047, 14855, 8876, 1206, 1032, 29473, 29508, 29491, 29518, 4921, 10326, 5106, 1065, 6121, 1968, 27934, 1040, 29473, 29508, 29491, 29542, 4921, 5050, 5106, 1610, 1328, 1040, 2480, 29501, 11744, 3984, 13594, 1065, 6121, 1968, 4313, 1968, 1040, 29473, 29508, 29502, 29491, 29555, 4921, 6825, 5106, 1070, 8975, 2611, 1125, 2259, 13047, 14855, 13204, 1054, 1040, 6646, 1232, 29481, 29473, 29538, 29491, 29552, 4921, 5106, 1610, 8975, 15954, 14855, 8251, 1206, 1032, 29473, 29549, 29491, 29551, 4921, 10326, 5106, 1065, 1040, 2480, 4138, 13594, 1065, 6121, 7499, 1163, 1032, 29473, 29518, 29491, 29508, 4921, 5106, 1122, 1040, 6646, 1610, 10959, 1935, 3735, 14855, 11157, 1968, 1787, 10324, 6825, 1065, 1040, 8347, 5042, 7101, 1040, 1181, 16958, 8975, 29402, 5106, 1065, 6121, 1245, 29473, 29555, 29491, 29555, 1066, 29473, 29551, 29491, 29502, 4921, 1610, 781, 781, 23891, 2438, 3338, 8975, 12371, 7060, 6825, 11120, 1066, 13204, 1040, 5050, 14449, 1610, 5392, 7060, 1065, 1040, 5192, 1422, 29473, 29508, 29502, 29491, 29542, 4921, 3515, 1647, 29501, 5335, 6925, 2080, 6646, 1346, 7060, 8251, 1254, 29473, 29552, 29491, 29518, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 2778351900, 'load_duration': 13748200, 'prompt_eval_count': 386, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1023750000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1738708000}"

None of the contacts expressed concern about inflation or the possibility of a downturn in the near future . First District Economic Indicators Through June The most recent economic indicators for the First District were mixed . Nonagricultural employment in the New England region , which closely overlaps the First District , declined in April , May and June . Although the moat recent reports from manufacturing respondents indicate that employment levels are stabilizing , the manufacturing sector was responsible for most of the decline in nonagricultural employment . Construction employment also fell in the second quarter ; however , housing permits and the value of nonresidential contract awards remained at high levels . Despite the sluggish employment performance , the New England unemployment rate fell to 3.3 percent in June .

Forecasts for the remainder of the year are closely tied to recent performance . For stores performing poorly , this represents a more negative outlook compared with earlier this year . Apparel Prices Because of the sizable apparel price increase in the CPI , inquiries about the sources of this increase were made among First District retailers . These retailers report that apparel import prices are rising substantially ( 10-25 percent compared to a year earlier ) ; they lay the blame for these increases on both the quota system and the decline in the value of the dollar . Prices of domestically produced apparel are increasing more gradually ; these domestic price increases are attributed to rising textile prices . Strong demand for apparel is leading to increases in the prices at which quotas are bought and sold among overseas manufacturers . Also , because the quotas limit the quantity ( not value ) of goods that foreign producers can send to the United States , the items now imported include fewer inexpensive goods .

290,"December 1 , 1987 The District economy continues to grow very slowly , driven mainly by expansion in manufacturing . Construction activity is showing renewed signs of weakness . The rise in drilling has begun to abate . Retail sales continue to be sluggish while auto sales are particularly weak . The balance sheets of District financial institutions fail to show any marked improvement . District agricultural product prices are markedly above a year earlier . Manufacturing Most District manufacturers indicate that demand for their products has risen somewhat in recent months , but manufacturers tied to the construction industry report slight declines in orders . Producers of oilfield equipment and other energy-related goods report gradual increases in output that are tied to increased drilling activity . These manufacturers expect additional expansions in sales next year as long as drilling activity does not fall below recent levels . Output remains high among defense contractors , but they express some concern about the negative effects deficit reduction might have on future defense spending . Chemical manufacturers and refiners continue to report strong demand . Orders to electrical and electronic equipment producers are stable and above year-earlier levels while orders to steel producers also remain strong .

299,"detrimental effects of a trade war with Japan . Japan is by far the most important export market for western products . One Arizona electronics manufacturer exports about 30 percent of its product to Japan . U.S. companies that have shifted manufacturing activities to Japan also expressed concern about the potential impact of more stringent tariffs . At the same time , some argue that the escalating trade friction has opened up Japanese markets to U.S. firms . In addition , both Taiwan and South Korea , fearing possible retaliatory actions against them , have taken significant steps to reduce tariffs and duties on a large number of items . Moreover , Japanese firms can be expected to continue shifting more production to the U.S. , with California a prime candidate for that investment . Finally , if allegations about semiconductor `` dumping '' are true , and if U.S. trade measures curtail dumping , western electronics firms should benefit . Agriculture and Resource Related Industries Prices for cattle and sheep have increased and reportedly are reaching profitable levels . However , ranchers remain cautious because higher prices tend to attract foreign imports in both markets . Prices of apples , potatoes and milk also have risen . Wheat prices , while up slightly in recent months , remain 22 percent below their year-ago levels . Weakness in hay , grain , and bean prices drove the Idaho farm price index down substantially in February , despite the improved livestock prices .

308,"May 3 , 1989 Summary Contacts in the Seventh District indicate that economic expansion is continuing but is less rapid than earlier . Payroll employment through February continued to trend upward in the District states about in line with the nation . Unemployment in the region averaged 5.3 percent of the labor force in February , down nearly to the national average of 5.1 percent after being higher since 1979 . However , in March unemployment rose in Illinois and Michigan in contrast with the further national decline . Hiring plans are strong in the Midwest . Chicago purchasing managers surveyed in March indicated that expansion of production , orders , and backlogs continued but was less widespread than last year . This less heated expansion was reflected in prices paid , which showed widespread increases but less so than earlier . Milwaukee purchasers ' reports have shown a similar trend over the past year . Higher petroleum prices are boosting costs for industry , transportation , and consumers . Contacts with industrial firms in the District have noted slower increases in orders or shipments for some types of machinery , paperboard , electronics , and rail transport .

309,"September 20 , 1989 Summary Retailers appear more optimistic about sales prospects for the balance of this year , although sales patterns have been mixed . Manufacturing activity remains at high levels , but softening is apparent even in some capital goods industries . Steel operations have been reduced largely because of inventory liquidation . Commercial and industrial loans continue to soften . Money market rates are expected to ease over the next few months , and the thrift bailout has resulted in lower rates on CDs issued by thrifts . Retail Sales Department store retailers have become more optimistic about fall and holiday-season sales prospects apparently because of better- than-expected sales so far this summer . Apparel sales in particular revived from the slump in 1988 , and profits and profit margins improved last quarter without more than usual sales promotions . Retailers plan to hold larger inventories than they did late last year . A chain department store , however , believes that retailers are too optimistic and that inventories will become a growing problem over the next few months . Another major chain retailer reports a spurt in July and August sales of household furnishings and home improvement products , but large inventories will require cutbacks in orders from some manufacturers . This retailer also expects a better fall and Christmas sales season this year than last .

Consumer Spending Several retailers report sales were better-than-expected over the past 6 weeks , and better than what has been reported in national data . Some retailers expect sales to soften this quarter , especially because of higher gasoline prices . An upscale retailer , however , noted a double-digit increase in spending last quarter and believes his upper-income customers are not much affected by a rise in interest rates . The automotive industry apparently is successfully offsetting higher interest rates by offering special financing rates and cash rebates that are the broadest and , in some cases , the most generous yet offered . Incentives are not as broad for foreign cars . Auto dealers report strengthening sales in early April .

Another retailer is concerned that further increases in interest rates will choke demand because of the link between consumer debt and interest rates . Auto dealers report February sales were averaging a little below average for this time of year and assert that publicity about rising interest rates has begun to affect sales .

Labor Markets The latest unemployment figures continue to show Pennsylvania at slightly below the national rate and Ohio at slightly above the national rate . Despite the relatively low unemployment rates , the average length of the workweek has remained constant and wage increases have been modest . However , many employers reported that benefit costs have risen significantly , driving up total compensation . Since last year at this time , Ohio added 90,000 jobs , raising employment by about 2 percent while the number of workers unemployed fell by 12 percent . The picture is similar in Pennsylvania , where jobs rose by 60,000 , increasing employment by 1 percent while decreasing unemployed workers by 17 percent . Although the labor market in these areas is generally strong , employers reported ample supplies of qualified workers . Eastern Kentucky , on the other hand , continues to experience a weak labor market . For example , a recent automobile plant opening there drew fifteen times as many applicants as there were job slots . Most of the new jobs in the District have come from the service sector , with business services continuing to show the largest increases . Manufacturing employment has been flat throughout most of Ohio , while Pittsburgh experienced its first annual increase in manufacturing employment in almost a decade .

Manufacturing Activity in the Third District industrial sector appears to be easing to a steady pace . Just over half of the manufacturers contacted in late March and early April reported that business was stable , and the number noting improvement barely exceeded the number indicating that their business was slowing . Reports of improvement were common among nondurable goods producers while most makers of durables said business has been flat in recent weeks . Overall , executives at area industrial firms generally noted modest increases in new orders and a fractional rise in shipments but no change in order backlogs during March . On balance , area firms are permitting inventories to run down for the fourth month in a row . Employment is holding up as area manufacturing firms added marginally to payrolls during March . Industrial prices in the region continue to rise . Nearly half of the manufacturers contacted in April said input costs moved up from a month earlier and one-quarter raised the prices of the products they make . The increases do not appear to be accelerating , however , as reports of higher prices are not quite as widespread now as they were over the winter . Nevertheless , local manufacturers generally expect continued upward price pressure . Looking ahead , local manufacturers see virtually steady conditions over the next six months .

Specific measures of industrial activity reflect this fractional growth . Area firms are booking more new orders than they did last month and they are stepping up shipments enough to work down order backlogs a bit . Inventories are level with last month . Employment shows only a little improvement as both payrolls and working hours are moving up just marginally . Survey respondents continue to report rising prices , although such indications do not appear to be as widespread this month as they have been for the past year . Nearly one-half of the firms polled for the March survey are paying higher prices for purchased goods compared to a month ago and one-quarter are charging more for their own products . Local manufacturers forecast only steady activity for the next six months , an improvement from the January and February surveys in which expectations of a downturn prevailed . The balance of responses to the most recent poll indicates that managers at area plants expect the rate of both new orders and shipments to be fairly flat for the next two quarters , and they anticipate a further decline in order backlogs . In accordance with these expectations , local firms ' employment plans call for steady payrolls and some shortening of the workweek between now and September .

Although slight gains were reported this summer , District residential construction growth remains sluggish . The value of District residential contracts issued in the first seven months of 1989 is virtually identical to that of a year earlier , with building of multi-family dwellings particularly weak . Agriculture Most District crops are in fair-to-good condition . Drier conditions in southern states have helped improve cotton and soybean crops that were damaged by excess rain earlier in the season . Continued rains in northern Missouri have helped drought-stressed late soybeans and pastures , but arrived too late to help the corn and sorghum crops . Agricultural banks servicing weather-stressed areas are not anticipating a substantial change in the quality of their agricultural loan portfolios this year . Banking District bank earnings declined 4.6 percent in the second quarter . Loan losses in the commercial area and additions to loan loss reserves hampered earnings . Asset quality declined during the second quarter , particularly at the largest banks where nonperforming loans represent 2.16 percent of total loans .

Capital goods industries are , on balance , pointing toward growth , and manufacturing is expected to strengthen in several Districts . Recent behavior in retail sales and reports from retailers in several Districts indicate that sales have been slow in recent months , and are expected to remain so in the short term . It is unclear how much of the recent softness in retail sales represents temporary factors , such as unusual weather over the last several months . Both residential and nonresidential construction have been edging downward in recent months in most Districts , and indicators of future construction suggest further softening . Prospects for a good harvest this year should be improved as a result of ample rainfall in previously drought-stricken regions of the country , but cool , wet weather has delayed planting by as much as several weeks . The slow-growth economy is accompanied by an easing in demand for credit . Real estate loans , consumer loans , and business loans are still growing , but at reduced rates in recent months . Lenders are reported to have tightened standards especially for real estate loans , but there is still little information that suggests credit restraint is spreading into other markets .

339,". Manufacturing Our regular mail survey suggested that District manufacturing activity declined slightly in early November . Respondents indicated that shipments , orders , and employment declined , but that inventories of raw materials and finished goods changed little . Most manufacturers felt that poor sales were their biggest problem , and manufacturers of furniture , textiles and apparel said their industries were definitely in recessions . Some manufacturers said that customers were increasingly reluctant to order very far ahead . Raw materials prices rose , but most manufacturers apparently held finished product prices steady . Even firms that use petroleum-based inputs like chemicals and plastics said that they had absorbed sharp increases in their raw material costs and had not increased prices of their finished goods . Manufacturers saw weakness in current economic conditions , but they were somewhat less pessimistic than a month ago about prospects for business next year . Most respondents believed that economic activity weakened in their local areas and in the nation in early November , and about half expected further weakening in the months ahead . A significantly larger number of respondents in November than in October , however , expected activity to pick up in coming months .

Port Activity Officials at District ports—Baltimore , Charleston , and Hampton Roads ( Norfolk ) —indicated that , seasonally adjusted , exports rose in October from September and imports were generally unchanged . Compared with a year ago , export activity was higher and import activity was mixed .

They complain that it is difficult to obtain high quality loan applications . Much of the reported increase in demand was attributed to market share gains by the reporting banks as borrowers moved from troubled or merged institutions . On the other hand , one banker said that his institution may have tightened credit standards too much and was losing market share as a result . Auto dealers and construction contractors continue to report that credit is difficult to obtain . Construction Most realtor contacts had seen home sales levelling in their typical seasonal pattern in October and early November .

347,"October 23 , 1991 Summary Underlying trends in the District economy have changed little over the past month , according to most contacts , although continued sluggishness in consumer demand has led to some slowing in the pace of recovery in industrial activity . Manufacturers generally continued to provide an important contribution to District growth , but several contacts stated that auto production gains could slow in the fourth quarter if car sales growth does not improve . District commercial and industrial loan demand remained soft , in part due to moderate requirements for inventory financing . The agricultural harvest is proceeding rapidly , and harvest estimates have been raised recently . Consumer Spending District contacts indicate that consumer spending gains remained sluggish in September and early October , with dollar sales depressed by intense price competition . A large general merchandise chain reported continued flat sales and stated that there was little sign of a recovery in consumer spending . A retailers ' association in Indiana stated that its membership 's sales growth generally remains flat , while losses from bad checks have not improved significantly .

Consumer Spending Second District department stores reported that sales growth was slightly stronger in April than in May . Although the range of year- to-year sales growth was quite similar for both months -- flat to +15 percent in April as compared to -3 percent to +15 percent in May -- more stores were clustered near the bottom of the range during the most recent period . Easter boosted sales of children 's clothing in April , while unusually cool weather slowed apparel sales the following month . All contacts reported inventories on plan . Fifteen New York metropolitan area department stores are scheduled to close by summer 's end , resulting in the loss of 7,200 jobs . Several of the stores are the last remaining retail anchors in older downtown areas ; the Fordham Road section of the Bronx and downtown Newark and New Rochelle are expected to be particularly hard hit . On a more positive note , a major New Jersey shopping mall has announced plans for expansion and renovation , including three new luxury department stores to replace two anchors which had previously closed .

Manufacturers noted increases in shipments and new orders although they continue to report declines in employment . Retailers generally indicated that both customer traffic and sales remained on an upward trend , and most of those contacted in late November said business was running at or above the pace they had expected for the month . Third District bankers noted an increase in demand for commercial and industrial loans . They said they continued to originate a large number of residential mortgages but applications for both refinancing and purchase mortgages had dropped sharply in recent weeks . Looking ahead , most of the Third District business contacts polled for this report anticipate continuing improvement at a modest pace . Manufacturers generally expect the upward trend in orders to remain intact , boosting order backlogs and prompting some increases in employment during the next six months . On the basis of the current pace of sales , retailers have raised their expectations for the Christmas season . Many believe that sales for this holiday period will exceed last year 's by a better margin than has been the case in recent years .

380,"June 23 , 1993 Summary Economic expansion in the District continued in May and early June . Reports from retailers and consumer goods manufacturers suggest that retail sales growth picked up modestly , aided in part by pent-up demand after unseasonably bad weather in the first quarter . Manufacturing activity continued its expansion , with slowing growth in some sectors offset by improving results in several industries that had previously been weak . Motor vehicle production continued to gain momentum , with output plans for the third quarter calling for a significant increase over year-earlier levels . Survey-based measures and reports from individual businesses gave no evidence of significant upward pressure on prices . Retail Sales Reports from large retailers and manufacturers of consumer goods suggest that consumer demand increased in the District in recent months . A large department store chain reported that sales growth in the Midwest increased moderately ( on a seasonally adjusted basis ) in May and early June , after a snapback in April from weather-depressed levels in the first quarter . Sales strength remained concentrated in durable goods , notably appliances and home improvement items . Credit utilization continued to rise and delinquency rates continued to improve . A large discount chain reported improvement in traffic and increased sales momentum during May and early June .

This firm expected same-store sales growth to improve modestly in the latter half of 1993 .

A manufacturer of heavy equipment experiencing renewed strength in most of its business lines cited the lack of a generalized upturn in demand for commodities as the most important factor leading sales of mining equipment to lag the companywide average . One manufacturer in an international market stated `` many of the price increases we do see are coming from the import side . '' Agriculture The pace in crop plantings improved considerably in recent weeks , overcoming most of the earlier delays from cool , wet weather . The delays may result in some modest shifting in the mix of crop acres . However , analysts believe that virtually all of the intended corn acreage in District states was seeded prior to the passing of critical planting dates . ( June 15 is generally regarded as the latest acceptable date for planting corn . ) Early crop development -- both for field crops and for much of the District 's vegetable acreage -- is below normal due to the late plantings . However , moisture supplies in most areas are adequate to abundant and the return of warmer weather brings hopes for faster crop development .",0.4,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T20:04:20.5076452Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.4}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 28377, 1603, 16853, 1254, 14319, 13479, 29481, 1610, 1098, 18514, 1070, 6685, 7876, 21766, 14061, 1054, 7110, 1065, 1848, 1070, 1639, 2723, 5483, 23649, 1040, 6270, 1070, 1032, 3720, 2100, 1100, 1215, 1221, 1065, 6405, 1122, 26562, 1986, 1158, 1040, 1848, 3046, 7767, 6142, 7060, 1070, 15889, 7876, 1066, 17137, 1040, 3264, 6502, 5919, 1610, 3155, 18514, 1065, 1164, 6379, 3436, 10024, 5776, 2055, 1070, 1040, 4912, 12863, 1246, 1279, 1800, 1228, 4292, 1245, 1040, 1494, 2849, 1610, 10610, 24605, 1250, 1183, 14449, 1065, 22716, 5868, 1510, 12725, 25781, 1065, 6159, 5355, 1968, 1522, 5111, 1848, 1070, 1040, 6353, 1650, 1516, 1245, 5874, 1968, 8337, 8854, 1610, 1183, 1650, 1516, 1761, 1972, 1065, 1509, 24444, 25102, 1065, 1040, 7518, 1070, 22716, 21415, 1610, 3761, 1968, 23043, 29481, 3859, 1137, 18394, 1312, 1070, 1040, 9694, 17637, 1032, 1729, 1233, 1065, 8975, 5373, 1171, 11825, 1054, 5449, 1066, 1040, 10488, 1070, 8044, 5868, 1056, 13559, 1610, 1093, 4980, 29473, 29508, 29550, 1117, 7509, 16158, 1158, 1040, 8113, 19404, 4376, 1122, 5868, 1056, 17637, 1610, 1911, 12906, 22716, 4867, 2707, 2328, 1122, 2602, 27920, 1072, 1122, 1956, 1070, 1040, 8975, 1232, 29481, 10803, 1290, 1032, 1729, 1233, 2707, 1117, 4392, 4891, 3708, 1066, 1040, 4677, 5868, 1510, 1610, 3761, 1968, 28992, 14447, 1065, 1848, 5788, 1228, 23961, 1066, 15884, 1208, 1072, 1040, 1372, 1070, 2264, 1562, 8854, 11932, 16489, 1122, 10324, 22716, 4867, 1610, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29549, 29520], 'total_duration': 2347548200, 'load_duration': 5549600, 'prompt_eval_count': 284, 'prompt_eval_duration': 831338000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1508330000}"
382,"March 10 , 1993 Summary District business activity continues to improve . Consumer spending is stronger than retailers expected after the December buying spree , with spring apparel and household durables selling particularly well . Orders and production schedules for many manufacturers , including steel , autos , and capital goods , are higher this quarter than last . Increased production and orders have led some companies to rehire workers , but employment gains still lag far behind output growth . Lenders report an increase in credit-card use and mortgage refinancing , but little growth in business loans . Consumer Spending District retail sales continue to be stronger than retailers expected , with sales reported to be 5 % to 10 % higher than last year at this time . The post-holiday performance has been particularly impressive because the companies interviewed have not been discounting prices heavily , as inventories of leftover winter goods are low and early orders for spring merchandise were conservative . Demand for spring fashions is significant , and consumers appear particularly interested in new design items as opposed to basic apparel . Retailers see this trend as indicating that consumers are moving beyond basic needs to more discretionary items .

Regarding the outlook for the holiday season , all respondents spoke of strong gains last year and the likelihood of much smaller year-to-year increases this Christmas . Citing consumer concern about continuing employment cutbacks and a consequent unwillingness to spend freely , most District retailers are planning for increases of 3 to 5 percent over last year 's holiday sales , with one respondent noting that no change over last year was a definite possibility .

Office leasing activity picked up in recent weeks , however , and primary vacancy rates declined in much of the District . New Jersey 's unemployment rate fell sharply in May while New York 's rate rose .

Some retailers noted a pickup in sales towards the end of May and into early June , however .

Contacts in both sectors see little price pressure and anticipate moderate growth for the remainder of the year . Commercial real estate continues steady , while investment management firms report strong growth . Retail Winter storms and cold temperatures took a considerable bite out of retail sales in the First District . Sales in January and early February were either flat or down , in some cases as much as 15 percent , compared to year-earlier levels . Apparel stores were particularly hard hit ; fewer shoppers took advantage of January promotions , leaving retailers with excess inventories of seasonal clothing . Contacts reported no significant rebound in sales after storms . The fortunate retailers were those with stocks of winter survival items , such as salt , dry gas , shovels , and cold medicine . Despite the short-term setback , retailers seem more optimistic about this year than last , anticipating 2 to 10 percent growth in sales . Many expect to see gross margins and profits increase as a result of fewer markdowns , better management of inventories , and continued cost controls . Retailers are encouraged by gains in the economy and consumer confidence ; however , they remain cautious in their capital spending and hiring plans .

398,"May 4 , 1994 Summary Seventh District economic conditions continued to improve in March and April , with retail sales boosted by substantially greater improvement in the weather than the norm for this time of year . Aside from the weather effects , the underlying upward momentum in consumption and housing activity may have slowed somewhat from the unusually rapid fourth quarter pace . Reports from manufacturers generally remained quite upbeat , although a number of manufacturing contacts expressed greater uncertainty about the pace of activity in their markets in the latter half of 1994 , citing the effects of increases in interest rates . Reports of price increases remained concentrated in building materials and metals industries . Early planting and weaker export prospects are currently weighing on crop prices , but District farmland values continued to appreciate in early 1994 . Retail Sales and Housing Consumer spending and housing activity continued to expand in the District in recent months , aided by substantial improvement in the weather following unusually harsh conditions earlier in the year . A large general merchandise retailer stated that underlying sales momentum remained positive through early April , with sales of home furnishings and other housing-related items still leading overall sales growth .

A survey of a large number of smaller retailers in Illinois and Indiana continued to show an improving trend in recent months . Home sales and construction activity surged in the region as 1993 came to a close , with little sign of a slowdown in the underlying momentum thus far in 1994 . Some realty and banking contacts attributed at least part of the increased activity to home buyers ' beliefs that mortgage interest rates may have stopped declining , leading sonic to conclude that the recent burst in activity could prove short-lived . Still , reports from local realtor boards in the region remained quite optimistic , with most noting that sales closings rose faster in January and February than in late 1993 . At the same time , the bad weather postponed home showings , which could be followed by slower growth in closings in March and April . One of the largest realtors in the District reported that transactions in January rose over 30 percent from year-earlier levels , partly due to special factors , but results were still a good deal better than expected .

400,"January and February 1993 , but retailers appear optimistic about recent sales gains and their implications for longer-term consumer demand . However , all of the respondents did speak of increasingly competitive market conditions and thinning profit margins . Housing and Construction The extremely strong performance of the housing sector in the last part of 1993 is not seen as sustainable . There is a sense that some of last year 's activity was driven by a belief that interest rates had reached their trough , triggering some amount of speculative buying . Nonetheless , 1994 is expected to be solid , reflecting strong underlying demand due to demographic factors , moderating long-term interest rates , and slight increases in income and employment . Housing markets in the Fourth District have been strong for some time , and more of the same is expected for 1994 . Lending Activity Consumers are said to `` look healthy '' : Delinquency rates are low and indexes of borrowing by existing customers are their strongest in more than two years . Commercial loans , which were down at the end of 1993 , picked up somewhat at the beginning of the year . The rise in interest rates has cooled mortgage refinancings , and slower growth in consumer loans is expected to ensue as a result of mortgage borrowing having reached its peak .

Consumer spending and tourism '' Retail trade is strong . '' reported an advisory council member from eastern North Dakota whose views are echoed by his colleagues , directors and other sources across the Ninth District . He noted that retail sales were slow on extremely cold days but rebounded when weather moderated . The owner of a Wisconsin chain of auto repair and accessory shops reported record sales in January . A consumer confidence poll conducted in Minnesota in early February showed the highest level since December 1989 . The increase was largely attributed to statements of increased willingness to spend on appliances and other major items . Vehicle sales continue above year- earlier levels in all states . Winter tourism was strengthening in late February after somewhat slower business in late January and early February . Skiing in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was down slightly for January and February due to cold weather , but out-of-state snowmobilers kept their vacation plans in northern Wisconsin .

Retail sales in most districts have improved , with nearly all districts reporting strong sales early in the holiday season . Manufacturing activity is increasing further in most districts , especially in durable goods industries , and the service sector is continuing to show strength . While single-family homebuilding continues to slow across most districts , commercial real estate markets and nonresidential construction have picked up in many districts . Loan demand is up in most districts , led by consumer loans and commercial and industrial lending . Farmers have harvested large crops in most parts of the nation but face generally low prices , as do cattle and hog producers . Energy activity in regions producing oil and natural gas has picked up somewhat . Prices of raw and intermediate materials continue to advance , with reports of some increases being passed through to final product prices . Labor markets in most districts have tightened further and more districts are reporting increasing wages in selected occupations . Retail Retail sales have strengthened in most districts .

While sales reports for October and early November were mixed due to unseasonably warm weather in some regions , Thanksgiving weekend sales were robust and year-over-year sales during the holiday season generally are expected to be strong .

411,"said sales for the months of January and February were adversely affected by winter storms and persistent difficult driving conditions that forced store closings and hampered shoppers getting to stores when they were open . Many merchants estimated that their sales for January were off as much as 20 percent from the sane month a year ago and that sales were down in February also . Auto dealers reported similar results . As a result of the falloff in sales , store executives said inventories were above desired levels , although most merchants said the overstocking was not extreme . Third District merchants are generally optimistic that sales will pick up for all lines of merchandise as spring approaches . Several said they believe a trend to higher levels of purchasing by consumers is underway and that retail sales will move up when extreme winter weather abates . Auto dealers also believe the basic sales trend is upward . Finance Third District bankers reported in February that loan volumes outstanding had declined from the beginning of the year , which they attributed mainly to seasonal factors .

Nonbank Financial Services Investment management firms report increased assets under management in the last six weeks . The increases are due to the rising market value of the assets and strong sales of domestic equity funds , particularly small company and growth funds . Bond funds experienced small but positive inflows . Municipal bond funds continue to be in net liquidation because of investor concerns about tax reform . Most respondents report stable or increasing employment levels .",0.3,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T20:06:35.8207102Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 29481, 4207, 1164, 2913, 5106, 3887, 1450, 1115, 1402, 20589, 1610, 2760, 28125, 8728, 23331, 5590, 20843, 4456, 1066, 3032, 1903, 23833, 1557, 7060, 1070, 19118, 2121, 10258, 1065, 1040, 4973, 8975, 1968, 6200, 26908, 1228, 1350, 7959, 1065, 1040, 2200, 1757, 4138, 1610, 2760, 20339, 1556, 1065, 24766, 1072, 11050, 1341, 8401, 1228, 1040, 1848, 1052, 1177, 1089, 4088, 1968, 25990, 1137, 7060, 7123, 1117, 2077, 1206, 4392, 29501, 4891, 6925, 1968, 2080, 8727, 1245, 19959, 1445, 2073, 1066, 17520, 5099, 1610, 24834, 1065, 24347, 1427, 1055, 15039, 2169, 1968, 1163, 1040, 8113, 7017, 20991, 1032, 6311, 4712, 4022, 1610, 2218, 28384, 7123, 1427, 2952, 1054, 1573, 1610, 3767, 10432, 7604, 1032, 6632, 14156, 1065, 7060, 1070, 7362, 9807, 1065, 17023, 1066, 13254, 29501, 4887, 1054, 13275, 16653, 1610, 2031, 1040, 1675, 1495, 1065, 3624, 2035, 1968, 7060, 1070, 1983, 2254, 29501, 1551, 5968, 9807, 1072, 1401, 7148, 1065, 17023, 1274, 29404, 1610, 1183, 3436, 1122, 3627, 29501, 1551, 5968, 9807, 1117, 6513, 1066, 1115, 1065, 1040, 2257, 6611, 1065, 1312, 5373, 1968, 19976, 1864, 1070, 1164, 11888, 1070, 3627, 1828, 29501, 19357, 16324, 1072, 1567, 3609, 6951, 7802, 1610, 9955, 14487, 17914, 8842, 12374, 1234, 6179, 19021, 3032, 8251, 13626, 1684, 6179, 1065, 1040, 2200, 4290, 5355, 1610, 1183, 12863, 1228, 3708, 1066, 1040, 12630, 3436, 1960, 1070, 1040, 13626, 1072, 3735, 7060, 1070, 13634, 23619, 11187, 1968, 7079, 2509, 3264, 1072, 6825, 11187, 1610, 20776, 11187, 9072, 2509, 1330, 6046, 4429, 4379, 1610, 26683, 10178, 11187, 4456, 1066, 1115, 1065, 3280, 12981, 1120, 1864, 1070, 3399, 1039, 11632, 1452, 4715, 10629, 1610, 5590, 10189, 1556, 3032, 12079, 1210, 7256, 14855, 6925, 1610, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29538, 29520], 'total_duration': 2698254300, 'load_duration': 657600, 'prompt_eval_count': 328, 'prompt_eval_duration': 930568000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1757506000}"

Autos Mixed impressions have emerged from the District 's major auto markets , with sales in Ohio better than in southwest Pennsylvania On balance , however , District auto sales during the last six weeks are down from the same period a year ago . Dealers cite a number of factors , including the unseasonable weather and higher interest rates , for this weakness . New car loan rates are approaching , or in some cases have already reached , double-digit levels . Surprisingly , auto credit is reported to be readily available , and local finance markets are said to be aggressively competing for borrowers . Moreover , higher bank rates for vehicle loans are being partially offset by factory incentives , including special financing arrangements and cash rebates . Auto inventories are higher than desired in many District markets . However , there are still shortages of a few popular vehicles , apparently resulting from production glitches rather than a shortage of capacity . Banking and Credit Loan activity is reported to be good , although some softening has been felt very recently , particularly in consumer lending .

Retail sales improved and manufacturers continued to operate at high levels of capacity . While single-family homebuilding slowed further , multifamily construction picked up in some parts of the district The district 's winter wheat crop was generally in good condition , and recent gains in crop and livestock prices have brightened the outlook for district farm incomes . While materials prices for manufacturers continued to rise throughout the region , upward pressure on wages was less prevalent . Retailers held prices steady despite increases in costs of goods and labor . Retail Sales Retailers report that sales improved over the past month and were ahead of year-ago sales . Much of the improvement , however , can be attributed to recent clearance promotions . Unseasonably warm weather continued to hamper sales of outerwear and other seasonal merchandise . Although retailers trimmed inventories , current inventory levels are generally considered satisfactory . Most auto dealers report slightly declining sales over the past month , due primarily to higher financing costs for consumers . Nevertheless , auto dealers expect sales to pick up in the spring .

Manufacturing Manufacturing activity in the Third District maintained a level pace in February according to reports from industrial firms , although slightly more firms said they were experiencing a pickup than said business was off . Firms in most of the major manufacturing sectors in the District indicated that demand for their products was just steady . However , some gains in orders were noted by firms producing metal products , nonelectrical machinery , chemicals , paper products , and textiles . Overall , however , demand for manufactured products did not appear to be strengthening for firms in the region ; on balance , they reported that order backlogs continued on the downward trend that began late last year . A dip in employment and a decline in industrial prices that manufacturers noted in February are further evidence of slack in the goods-producing sector of the District .

The tourism sector remains robust , and loan demand continues to expand moderately . Employers are increasing benefits to retain workers in tight labor markets , but intense competition and long-term contracts are expected to keep prices stable . Consumer Spending District sales improved overall in August after a mixed July , as most contacts reported that sales were up slightly compared with a year ago .

Indeed , the rate of joblessness in some areas has descended to levels previously unseen ( about 2 % in the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region . ) The District 's temporary employment agencies were unable to keep pace with demand in February , and all of the agencies surveyed indicate having increased wages since the beginning of the year for a wide range of workers . Several agencies are preparing for another round of wage increases within the next few months . General laborers are in short supply in the southern parts of the District , even in the manufacturing sector where labor markets have been softer . Elsewhere , firms continue to report a shortage of administrative support , including experienced secretaries . District transporters report a leveling off in shipping activity this year , and business is modestly below levels of a year ago . International traffic has improved , as both imports and exports have grown since the last report . Imports remain especially strong , however , and the imbalance between imports and exports persists . Shippers are expected to hike rates on Asian routes to compensate for capacity excesses on return trips . Agricultural commodity prices , which have stabilized recently , are substantially below levels of a year ago , although dairy prices remain elevated .

Like most other retailers , auto dealers remain very optimistic about sales in the near future . Manufacturing Tenth District manufacturing activity held steady last month , albeit at a relatively weak level . Plants were operating at similar capacities - medium to high - as in our previous survey , but still well below levels posted a year ago . Manufacturing materials were generally available with lead times practically unchanged , and managers had little concern about availability in the near future . Factories began modestly increasing inventories in March and early April , and managers were happier with current stock levels than in the recent past . The increases were small , however , and most survey contacts anticipate having to trim inventories in coming months as stiff competition from low-price imports continues . Housing Construction activity remained strong last month , although housing starts in some parts of the district were slightly below last year 's pace . Nearly all builders expect even better performance in the months ahead . For the first time in several surveys , a majority of builders complained of difficulties obtaining materials , particularly sheetrock .

Mining and Energy The metal-based mining industries are starting to rebound as evidenced by increases in iron ore production . Increases in steel plant utilization and reductions in iron ore inventories have spurred some iron ore mines to reopen . A Minnesota iron ore mine production line reopened in September and two Michigan iron ore mines reopened in October . Most mine workers have agreed to a five-year contract , which should reduce the risk of work stoppages . Meanwhile , oil exploration activity has picked up . In October , 10 rigs were operating in North Dakota , three rigs in South Dakota and four rigs in Montana as compared to four , zero and four , respectively , in July . In addition , August oil production in the district was up 2 percent from June production levels . Agriculture Current crop production forecasts for the district suggest a bountiful harvest . Expected soybean , hay and sugarbeet production for Minnesota , the Dakotas and Montana in 1999 is above the hefty 1998 harvest levels . However , expected 1999 corn production in Minnesota and the Dakotas is 10 percent below the record 1998 harvest amounts , and 1999 small grain production in North Dakota is significantly below 1998 levels . Farm income , however , remains depressed as dismal agricultural prices are offsetting the bumper crop .

Energy activity in most regions has been slow to react to the recent increases in oil prices , although expectations of a solid recovery are high . Labor markets remain very tight in almost all districts , with increased reports of upward pressure on wages in many parts of the country .",0.8,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T20:11:00.2148065Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.8}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 29566, 2570, 29473, 29508, 29552, 1968, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29542, 29542, 8975, 8727, 12402, 1137, 1040, 1268, 29491, 29503, 29491, 9493, 8288, 3735, 1968, 1163, 22490, 1065, 7123, 24491, 1610, 9105, 1382, 7123, 1065, 1848, 24625, 1427, 5662, 2396, 2260, 1070, 4712, 1056, 1968, 1072, 14544, 7112, 1350, 17658, 1452, 1040, 9493, 1610, 7202, 9324, 1557, 1510, 1072, 9377, 12767, 4678, 7079, 1930, 1065, 4767, 1072, 3014, 1610, 20431, 2146, 7123, 11120, 1066, 5684, 1065, 1848, 5788, 1245, 1040, 1903, 23833, 1557, 5099, 1070, 1040, 3377, 1647, 1072, 1032, 3563, 1610, 19628, 1070, 2027, 5675, 1158, 14812, 1831, 1968, 27282, 1968, 6685, 23756, 1968, 1072, 7148, 7876, 1427, 1518, 4780, 3735, 1968, 6200, 1509, 23782, 1968, 2027, 1158, 10213, 1072, 1722, 24872, 1968, 4456, 1066, 2873, 17284, 9763, 1245, 7991, 23630, 1610, 22829, 11120, 1066, 3101, 1206, 1032, 1938, 3374, 14449, 6241, 1040, 6646, 1968, 1436, 1092, 1661, 1254, 3735, 2379, 7060, 1065, 1848, 5867, 1070, 1040, 3707, 1610, 12298, 2059, 1070, 8347, 1072, 7837, 1968, 4313, 1968, 1274, 17728, 1065, 5105, 4435, 7734, 1065, 1509, 24625, 1610, 1161, 3338, 7123, 8288, 3735, 1065, 1848, 24625, 8345, 1032, 4712, 4022, 1065, 2560, 1030, 1602, 1510, 3708, 1066, 7959, 5105, 18990, 8746, 1610, 1328, 1040, 23583, 9493, 1968, 7253, 1072, 5868, 1056, 5099, 1274, 1518, 10198, 1610, 2155, 1117, 2396, 7765, 2211, 1452, 7122, 1065, 6022, 1065, 29473, 29508, 29542, 29542, 29542, 1968, 1158, 1848, 23583, 26562, 1240, 9274, 7112, 3627, 1610, 15038, 7123, 1065, 1848, 11310, 1427, 1518, 4712, 1066, 13803, 1066, 1040, 6159, 12863, 1065, 6271, 9274, 1968, 6200, 14647, 1070, 1032, 7629, 12874, 1228, 2254, 1610, 14928, 12342, 7112, 1983, 7743, 1065, 3547, 1312, 24625, 1968, 1163, 8251, 8727, 1070, 26014, 7171, 1124, 24878, 1065, 2055, 5867, 1070, 1040, 3707, 1610, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29551, 29520], 'total_duration': 3024180000, 'load_duration': 4024200, 'prompt_eval_count': 346, 'prompt_eval_duration': 990637000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 2024797000}"
488,". Other Business Activity Regional purchasing managers ' surveys indicate steady growth in manufacturing activity in June and July , along with increased upward price pressures . New York purchasing managers report that manufacturing activity expanded at a brisk pace in both June and July , following a dip in May . Buffalo-area purchasers report that production activity grew at about the same modest pace in July as in the second quarter , while new orders and employment levels were little changed . Surveys in both these areas indicate a noticeable pickup in prices for manufacturing inputs . There have been reports of significant shipping delays due to the merger of Conrail into CSX and Norfolk Southern , though contacts do not see any problems comparable to last year 's merger between Union Pacific and Southern Pacific . One contact at a short-line railroad in upstate New York says that , while delays persisted in July , they were not as bad as in June ; conditions are expected to be back to normal by around the end of October . Some shipping has been diverted to trucks , but not much . Hotel occupancy rates in New York City held steady throughout the second quarter at just above 80 percent -- a high level but about 5 points lower than a year earlier . After registering double-digit increases through much of 1998 , room rates are currently running just 2 percent higher than a year ago .

489,"June 16 , 1999 The District 's economy continues to expand , though at a somewhat slower pace than in the last report . While there are scattered reports of upward price pressures , they appear to remain relatively subdued . Most retailers report that sales were above plan in May , despite unseasonably cool weather which held down sales of summer merchandise . Residential real estate markets remain strong , though activity appears to have leveled off in the second quarter , largely due to supply constraints . Regional purchasing managers report a slowdown in manufacturing activity in May , along with some upturn in input prices . The breakup of Conrail and its recent merger into CSX and Norfolk Southern appears to have caused only minor operational glitches thus far . Local banks report a dip in demand for residential mortgages and consumer loans , and continued improvement in delinquency rates . Consumer Spending Retailers report that sales were on or above plan in May , and would have been stronger still , except that unseasonably cool weather held down sales of summer merchandise . Overall , same-store sales for May were up by roughly 4 percent on average , though individual gains ranged from 2 to 8 percent . However , these figures understate underlying growth since they are based on a 4-week month that included Memorial Day in 1998 but not in 1999 . Virtually all contacts report very strong follow-through in sales in late May and early June .

490,"January 20 , 1999 Economic growth in the District has picked up further since the last report , with very few signs of upward price pressures . Although retailers report mixed sales results for December , all experienced a strong pickup toward the end of the month , buoyed by cold weather and steep discounting ; inventories were generally said to be in good shape in early January . The housing market continued to gain momentum in the fourth quarter , led by a strong rebound in New York City 's co-op and condo market , continued brisk activity in the suburbs , and a marked recovery in sales activity in upstate New York . Manhattan 's office market remains tight , although vacancy rates edged up from cyclical lows recorded in the third quarter ; rents continued to rise , albeit at a slower pace than earlier in the year . Regional surveys of purchasing managers indicate a widening divergence between the manufacturing sector , which weakened in December , and non-manufacturing sectors , which continued to strengthen . New York City purchasers note that upward cost pressures for most contracted services moderated in December , while prices of other goods and services were flat .

Dairy farmers continued to face low product prices as milk production continued to expand year-over-year .

504,"January 19 , 2000 Reports from most Federal Reserve Districts indicated strong economic growth in December and early January . Economic activity was described as strong in most Federal Reserve Districts . Growth was characterized as solid in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts , and as moderate in the Districts of Atlanta and Chicago . Consumer spending growth was rapid during the holiday shopping period , and many retailers expect the high level of activity to continue into early 2000 . Manufacturing continued to expand in nearly every District and was broadly based across industries . Exceptions to this were in the food , apparel , agricultural equipment , and some construction-based industries . Residential real estate construction was mixed across regions , with the northeastern states experiencing an inventory shortage , the southern and midwestern states a slowdown , and the western states an expansion . Commercial construction activity varied across the country . Bank lending was mixed , with a decrease in mortgage lending that was often offset by increases in consumer and commercial lending . Labor markets remained tight in all Districts . However , the tight labor markets did not seem to be matched with large wage increases . Most consumer prices appear to be holding steady in much of the country , although a few Districts reported moderate increases . Producer prices also appear to be flat , with the exception of rising petroleum prices .

However , labor markets have remained fairly buoyant , although less so than they had been earlier in the year . Industrial Activity The steel industry is facing some tough times . Mills are operating 10 to 30 percent below capacity , domestic demand has slowed , and there is intense competition from foreign producers , in part due to the strong dollar . Several firms have filed for chapter 11 , and more filings are expected . January orders are a little stronger than December 's , but first-quarter orders are expected to be weak . Producers of specialty steel are in a better position . While prices on specialty steel products decreased along with carbon steel , orders for specialty steel remain stronger . Consumer Spending Retail stores reported disappointing sales during the entire holiday season , with the lackluster performance extending across all categories .

Consumer spending was mixed—aggressive financing incentives drove automobile and light truck sales to exceptional levels , but tourism remained weak and nonauto sales were spotty , with stronger sales growth in some areas offset by weaker sales elsewhere . Retailers ' outlook for spending during the upcoming holiday season was also mixed .

Despite recent easing in oil prices , contacts in the Dallas , Kansas City , and Minneapolis districts reported that oil and natural gas prices remain sufficiently high to promote continued expansion of exploration and production . However , Dallas and Kansas City reported that the pace of industry expansion is constrained by worker and equipment shortages . Given these shortages , the recent dramatic rise in natural gas prices is not expected to produce a further acceleration in drilling activity . Other extraction industries are not doing as well , as metal mining and processing activity in the Minneapolis district continued to decline in the face of falling commodity prices and high electricity costs . In the farm economy , the onset of winter weather across the country has had mixed effects . Minneapolis reported that moisture from heavy snowfalls has benefited the winter wheat crop and is expected to reduce the likelihood of drought conditions in the coming growing season . However , severe winter weather also contributed to a worsening in pasture conditions for livestock and an increased use of alternative forages in the Richmond , Minneapolis , Kansas City , and Dallas districts . The alternative supplies seem to be generally available except for some reports of hay shortages in the Dallas district .

Manufacturing Typically , manufacturing conditions are similar throughout the District , but this year growth rates appear erratic between the northern and southern parts of the District . The northern region , which had reported deceleration in growth and only modest improvement in the last report , experienced strong growth during this survey period . Although the southern area reported strong growth in April , reports suggested a slight contraction in May . Conditions throughout the District have fluctuated monthly between contraction and expansion . Automakers in the District reported significant amounts of overtime , with one plant reporting overtime during all seven weeks beginning April 15 , two reporting six weeks with overtime activity , and another reporting five weeks with overtime . No plants reported closing during the last half of April or the month of May . In the steel industry , reports ranged from `` fairly strong '' to `` very slow '' activity . In general , steelmakers that supply materials and parts to automakers reported strong conditions ; those that supply construction companies reported stable conditions ; and those that sell to others reported poor conditions ( others include oil , tubular goods , commercial aerospace , and power generation companies ) .

While steel producers still reported excess capacity in the industry , area contacts noted that capacity utilization has increased for most area plants . Retail Sales Area retailers continued to report mixed conditions .",0.3,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T20:13:43.4983343Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 1142, 23762, 1066, 5965, 2212, 29473, 29518, 29502, 1072, 29473, 29550, 29502, 4921, 1070, 3870, 10213, 7060, 1610, 20431, 2146, 16401, 2712, 1968, 15954, 5099, 1228, 4452, 6241, 1040, 8975, 1968, 1330, 1224, 1647, 6825, 8746, 5073, 1934, 2479, 2212, 1040, 13495, 1072, 12995, 5867, 1070, 1040, 8975, 1610, 1183, 13495, 5192, 1968, 1458, 1321, 6513, 2053, 8476, 1120, 1065, 6825, 1072, 1633, 24444, 14972, 1065, 1040, 2200, 3032, 1968, 9072, 3735, 6825, 2706, 1224, 11679, 3984, 1610, 6568, 1040, 12995, 3466, 6513, 3735, 6825, 1065, 4767, 1968, 8727, 9518, 1032, 6311, 4956, 2542, 1065, 3014, 1610, 12652, 2833, 6241, 1040, 8975, 1274, 20131, 26241, 15658, 2212, 4956, 2542, 1072, 11888, 1610, 16707, 9542, 1065, 1040, 8975, 6513, 6632, 15606, 1070, 1522, 2304, 1968, 1163, 1392, 5868, 15206, 1522, 2304, 2706, 1312, 7439, 5355, 6166, 4767, 29473, 29508, 29550, 1968, 1757, 15206, 4290, 5355, 1163, 1522, 2304, 7123, 1968, 1072, 2466, 15206, 4127, 5355, 1163, 1522, 2304, 1610, 2538, 10691, 6513, 13752, 2706, 1040, 2200, 3563, 1070, 4767, 1210, 1040, 2870, 1070, 3014, 1610, 1328, 1040, 10213, 5547, 1968, 8727, 1176, 4953, 1245, 5776, 12503, 3735, 10610, 1066, 5776, 1983, 4712, 10610, 7123, 1610, 1328, 3720, 1968, 10213, 22784, 1137, 8770, 7837, 1072, 5867, 1066, 5375, 9542, 6513, 3735, 5099, 3521, 2163, 1137, 8770, 7148, 5567, 6513, 12079, 5099, 3521, 1072, 2163, 1137, 6880, 1066, 3431, 6513, 6134, 5099, 1093, 3431, 3792, 6271, 1968, 12756, 1866, 12050, 1968, 8148, 1032, 11435, 3412, 1968, 1072, 2750, 9110, 5567, 1911, 1610, 781, 781, 24243, 10213, 23630, 2077, 6513, 12222, 9212, 1065, 1040, 5547, 1968, 3466, 20843, 9427, 1137, 9212, 5247, 2605, 1427, 8251, 1122, 1848, 3466, 10691, 1610, 9105, 1382, 17145, 15256, 12371, 1172, 6085, 1066, 3032, 10198, 5099, 1610, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29538, 29520], 'total_duration': 2642832100, 'load_duration': 4405300, 'prompt_eval_count': 341, 'prompt_eval_duration': 990465000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1644665000}"

Consumer spending was again relatively weak , and caution persisted in businesses ' capital spending and hiring plans . Strength continued in sales of both new and existing homes , while nonresidential building and real estate activities were again soft . Manufacturing activity remained generally weak but appeared to have improved further from our last report . Bankers continued to report strong mortgage demand from households and weak loan demand from businesses . There were a few new reports of input cost increases , particularly for energy , but prices at the retail level remained largely in check . District farmland values in 2002 posted the largest year-over-year gain since 1997 , even as concerns increased about the impact of drought and continued low dairy prices . Consumer Spending Overall consumer spending remained weak in January and February . Most retail contacts indicated that sales results in January fell short of their conservative expectations , although one national chain noted some slight improvement in February . Merchants said that sales of food and consumables were stronger than other items , particularly apparel . Inventories generally remained lean as retailers sought to tightly control stocks , although one merchant reported that inventories were rising faster than sales .

A contact in casual dining noted that sales had been softening since mid-January , in part because of bad weather and increased fears of terrorism .

545,"business demand was reflected in relatively flat loan volumes , a trend that has persisted over the past six months . Banks that did experience volume increases suggested that the gains were due to market share shifts rather than a general increase in demand . On balance , banks did not appear to be tightening standards on business loans , and there were a few reports that overall business loan quality had improved slightly . Prices and Employment Costs There were a few new reports of increasing input costs , but retail price increases remained largely subdued . Of particular concern to many contacts were rising prices of energy and inputs derived from petroleum . One contact said that prices for diesel fuel had risen to `` frighteningly high '' levels , which could potentially send some small freight carriers into bankruptcy . By contrast , steel prices were said to be stabilizing after some significant increases in 2002 . There were no new reports of intensifying pressure on wages , and some companies were said to have delayed merit increases until later in the year . Businesses continued to express concern over rising health and other insurance costs . Despite some increases in input costs , fierce price competition kept most output prices in check . Small-business owners appeared particularly concerned with this trend , as they were finding it increasingly difficult to compete with larger producers on price .

Dealer inventories have risen and become somewhat `` bloated '' because of soft sales and increased shipments from manufacturers attempting to reduce their own inventories as the model-year ends . Construction Sales were strong in residential construction in August and September . In Ohio , August home sales were up 18 percent over last year . Some of the increase was attributable to customers purchasing in anticipation of rising interest rates .

Though most contacts could not immediately discern the total impact , retail and manufacturing experienced the greatest impact as a result of closures . Other sectors of the economy experienced minor or no problems due to the electricity problems . Manufacturing Most manufacturing contacts reported continued improving conditions in July and August . However , unlike the previous report , a few contacts did note declines in both production and sales . Overall , both production and sales were higher during this period than in the most recent report and during the same time last year , with nondurable goods manufacturers generally citing more favorable conditions than durable goods producers . Inventory levels were flat during this time period , with idle capacity remaining relatively the same as well . While most manufacturers said they were maintaining their current workforce levels , the proportion of firms reporting new hires was greater than those cutting payrolls . Most contacts still anticipate moderate sales and production growth by year 's end . Auto production fell again at most District plants in July and early August compared with June , but it should be noted that many facilities re-tooled in early July . Regardless , same-model production was about 4 percent lower than 2002 levels . In July , three new models began production in the District . A few facilities reported the use of overtime .

560,"January 15 , 2003 The Second District 's economy has been mixed since the last report with weakness in retail sales and some easing off in the housing market but with signs of a pickup in manufacturing and some stabilization in commercial real estate . Retailers mostly indicate that holiday and post-holiday sales were below plan ; both selling prices and merchandise costs were described as steady to lower than a year ago , but retail inventories were said to be at manageable levels . Manufacturers and purchasing managers indicate steady to improved activity in recent weeks and steady to lower prices . Port traffic is also described as strong . Housing markets and construction activity have shown further signs of slowing in recent weeks , especially at the upper end of the market , though the general level of activity remains robust . New York City 's office market showed signs of stabilizing in the final two months of 2002 , though rents were sharply lower than at the end of 2001 . Finally , bankers report increased demand for commercial loans and nonresidential mortgages , tighter lending standards in those same categories , and steady to lower delinquency rates . Consumer Spending Most retailers report that holiday sales in the district were disappointing . Sales were particularly sluggish during the first half of December and , sales for the month as a whole were mostly below plan .

Conditions in the manufacturing sector , on the other hand , improved further nationwide , especially among capital equipment and other durable goods makers . Residential construction activity remained at high levels but slowed a bit in some regions ; nonresidential construction remained tepid , as did demand for commercial and industrial space . Agricultural conditions were mixed and generally tied to the weather . Demand for consumer loans softened somewhat , but several districts noted increased commercial lending . Employers in most districts continued to expand payrolls , though districts reported some unevenness across sectors . While persistently rapid increases in nonwage labor costs continued to be a concern for many employers , wage pressures remained modest . Consumer prices were generally flat or up modestly , although there were noticeable price increases for energy and some material inputs .

Similarly , in Manhattan 's co-op and condo market , selling prices per square foot were up 4 percent to 5 percent from the second quarter and up 15 percent from a year earlier ; the volume of transactions was up marginally , though contacts report that this is partly a function of a low inventory of homes on the market . Manhattan 's rental market has been generally stable since the last report : one contact reports that , following a dip in the second half of September , leasing activity has picked up again in October -- particularly at the high end -- though rents remain flat . Office markets in the New York City area were again mixed in the third quarter . Manhattan 's office market was little changed overall , as continued gradual improvement in Midtown Manhattan offset an upturn in vacancies in Lower Manhattan . Outside New York City , conditions were also mixed : Long Island 's vacancy rate declined for the fourth consecutive quarter , falling to a three-year low , but northern New Jersey 's vacancy rate climbed to 18 percent , the highest level in nearly a decade .

Manufacturing District manufacturers saw further solid increases in production and sales across a wide range of products .

District apparel makers saw rising orders and inventories remained lean . The main exception to strong conditions was in the commercial aircraft sector , where orders remained somewhat weak and employment counts fell a bit further . More generally , rising demand has prompted some manufacturers to increase hiring , and a machine tool manufacturer in the Pacific Northwest noted growing difficulties finding qualified labor for available openings .

Despite the lackluster rental market in Boston , property values there and across New England continue to increase , fueled by an abundance of low cost capital . However , contacts note that currently rising costs of capital and low property yields could lead commercial real estate prices to correct downwards . Another factor buoying property values is rising construction costs . One contact estimated that building replacement costs increased by 10 percent to 15 percent over the past year , making existing buildings relatively more attractive .

Some retailers cite recent reductions in consumer spending resulting from high gasoline prices , which they predicted earlier , but had not yet observed six or 12 weeks ago . Manufacturers are facing cost increases , but vary considerably in their ability to raise their own prices . Residential real estate markets in New England are becoming `` more reasonable '' as they cool slightly from record highs . Retail Retail respondents in the First District report mixed results for the quarter ending in September . While the quarter 's sales were mostly ahead of year-earlier levels , several contacts note a marked slowdown in the closing weeks . According to one contact in the apparel industry , same-store sales were up more than 4 percent in the third quarter partly due to better merchandising decisions , but year-to-date sales are virtually unchanged from last year . Another apparel contact noted that same-store sales were either up marginally or flat compared with a year ago in the months of August and September , with overall year-to-date sales still up just slightly from last year . Both respondents emphasized the negative impact skyrocketing fuel prices are having and threaten to continue to have on consumer spending .

Demand has slowed for corrugated boxes , and contacts in this industry have become less positive about the outlook . High-tech manufacturers said shipments were still strong , but there is continued uncertainty about the outlook . Demand continued to slow for products used in residential construction , but some firms said recent slowing may have been partially weather-related . Producers of stone , clay and glass reported sales declines of as much as 20 percent from a year ago , and inventories are up for some products . Lumber producers reported a significant drop in demand and increase in inventory over the past month , mostly because of reduced demand from national markets , although sales in Texas were also weaker . Producers of wood products , such as cabinets , say demand is unchanged . A few producers of construction-related products report that some large publicly-traded builders have sent letters asking for price reductions to help them achieve quarterly income projections . This has led producers to become wary about doing business with these builders . Fabricated metals producers report no change in sales volume but had become more optimistic . Demand for residential construction products has been soft , but sales to the energy industry remain strong .

Primary metals producers reported little change in demand overall , with strong demand for commercial building helping compensate for slowing activity from the residential sector .",0.3,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T20:18:00.7315037Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 28377, 1983, 3735, 1072, 13825, 1369, 1224, 2870, 1968, 1458, 20843, 7604, 1066, 4657, 5903, 21020, 9274, 11742, 1056, 10694, 7123, 1610, 5035, 1159, 1427, 29404, 1122, 2043, 11677, 1369, 14214, 1968, 1072, 20843, 1065, 1224, 5547, 1274, 3495, 2876, 6046, 1452, 1040, 1343, 6587, 1610, 5324, 29501, 14197, 20013, 1541, 5077, 2107, 1422, 2077, 3735, 1968, 1330, 1504, 1117, 6085, 18878, 1452, 1040, 1343, 6587, 1610, 5035, 1159, 6085, 1066, 4712, 1122, 4844, 2075, 1065, 19118, 7148, 1968, 1330, 1509, 19021, 1541, 6159, 4712, 1056, 1761, 1274, 1518, 20734, 8854, 29501, 10414, 1610, 1901, 6782, 1172, 1070, 8021, 1968, 27046, 1072, 6020, 6513, 7060, 4568, 2071, 1070, 1158, 1956, 1158, 29473, 29518, 29502, 4921, 1245, 1032, 1647, 4352, 1968, 1072, 9950, 3188, 1228, 1350, 1122, 1509, 4844, 1610, 1161, 1799, 23630, 6513, 1032, 6632, 6856, 1065, 6405, 1072, 6015, 1065, 20698, 1522, 1040, 3377, 2870, 1968, 8212, 1864, 1070, 10165, 6405, 1245, 5050, 12342, 1968, 6200, 7060, 1065, 8594, 1422, 1603, 1246, 5544, 1610, 1901, 6782, 1172, 1070, 5536, 4844, 1968, 2027, 1158, 15253, 2236, 1968, 2083, 6405, 1117, 1289, 12015, 1610, 1098, 2432, 23630, 1070, 7148, 29501, 10414, 4844, 3032, 1137, 1509, 3243, 19968, 29501, 1202, 9512, 2581, 1172, 1274, 3430, 9949, 7969, 1122, 4912, 3998, 2076, 1066, 2084, 1474, 7387, 9017, 1114, 8672, 1198, 19870, 1610, 1619, 1427, 4931, 23630, 1066, 3495, 1043, 1396, 1452, 3316, 2723, 1163, 1935, 2581, 1172, 1610, 12823, 2259, 1369, 2192, 1741, 23630, 3032, 1476, 3036, 1065, 7060, 8299, 1330, 1321, 3495, 1448, 7765, 4088, 1610, 5035, 1159, 1122, 19118, 7148, 4844, 1427, 1518, 3432, 1968, 1330, 7060, 1066, 1040, 4176, 5547, 7112, 3735, 1610, 781, 781, 18534, 2192, 1741, 23630, 6513, 2396, 3036, 1065, 6405, 8312, 1968, 1163, 3735, 6405, 1122, 8148, 4435, 9306, 13381, 1148, 1122, 4712, 1056, 7123, 1245, 1040, 19118, 10410, 1610, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29538, 29520], 'total_duration': 2934277000, 'load_duration': 940200, 'prompt_eval_count': 357, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1012542000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1912926000}"

632,"September 5 , 2007 For most first District businesses contacted in the second half of August , recent results are similar to the last few reports -- some up , some down -- but they express increased uncertainty looking forward . Many contacts report that turmoil in financial markets is obscuring their near-term outlook . Price pressures are said to have eased somewhat , while selected professional and technical workers remain in short supply . Retail Retailers in the First District report mixed sales results during the summer months . Same-store sales ranged from low double-digit decreases to single-digit increases . Furniture , apparel and accessories , and computers were among the items that reportedly sold well . Inventory levels are mixed , while headcounts are generally stable ( except in connection with store openings ) . Capital spending is also varied , with several retailers reporting slight increases in spending levels because of acquisitions , store openings , and systems upgrades . Contrary to recent periods , most contacts cite decreased vendor price pressure , with the exception of paper and some metals . One contact says excess supplies of lumber have pushed prices down . Selling prices are generally stable . Respondents are cautious though optimistic in their outlook ; most expressed concern with consumer confidence going forward .

While one retailer expects fallout from the current turmoil in financial markets to be manageable , another asked `` will the consumer step up to the plate and keep shopping and buying ?

According to some estimates , the drought could cost Georgia and Florida farmers over $ 2 billion in lost production . Nevertheless , a report from Chicago indicated that even with unfavorable weather , the District was poised for a record corn harvest because farmers had planted more corn at the expense of soybeans .

In the metropolitan areas of Boston , Hartford , and Providence , office rent growth appears close to zero after concessions are taken into account . The industrial property market has been very weak in both Connecticut and Rhode Island -- in the latter case , vacancies are up and rents are down ( both modestly ) compared to last year . Sales activity is limited as credit remains very tight and buyers and sellers hold out for their preferred prices . Investment sales and new construction have been hit particularly hard . For example , three major building projects in downtown Boston ( office and mixed-use high rises ) are said to be currently languishing as they scramble to obtain tenant commitments and financing . As evidence that property valuations have fallen relative to operating incomes , sources report that capitalization rates for commercial property in greater Boston are now approaching 7 percent , up from last summer 's estimated 5 percent . Despite enjoying brisk business and high commercial mortgage interest rates , a small Boston mutual bank foresees that it could run up against lending capacity constraints before year 's end .

In the financial sector , several contacts in the mortgage industry reported pressure on margins for residential mortgages from recent pricing increases in the secondary market . Wage pressures remained limited outside of skilled labor positions that continue to experience shortages . Agriculture Crop conditions improved in the District as sufficient moisture remained from earlier rains to offset dry weather in August . Replanted fields may boost soybean production above current published estimates . Contacts reported that corn and soybean fields were at least two weeks behind the typical stages of development , making crop yields more vulnerable than usual to an early frost . Concerns about risks for 2009 grew as farmers faced higher planting costs while having fewer options to lock in prices for their crops . These circumstances have led parties in transactions to more fully investigate the financial health of their counterparties . Hay supplies improved with new cuttings , and pastures were in good shape . Corn and soybean prices fell during the reporting period . However , livestock producers still struggled with high feed costs . Hog producers benefited from higher hog prices .

Lower corn prices eased margins for several ethanol producers reducing delays and allowing some new plants to start production .",0.4,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T20:20:38.8099981Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.4}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 29491, 2155, 1422, 1603, 3624, 8727, 1070, 2223, 29501, 15736, 1070, 1935, 5105, 7734, 1066, 1828, 4656, 9274, 1968, 1157, 11711, 1066, 1032, 1983, 7284, 11893, 1122, 18677, 2027, 1158, 19118, 7148, 1072, 12371, 6994, 1610, 1328, 1040, 6361, 10410, 1968, 3624, 20843, 1065, 1040, 18990, 5547, 6513, 7171, 1124, 15771, 1894, 1122, 19118, 6229, 29489, 2059, 1245, 6159, 23187, 12863, 1065, 1040, 14229, 3436, 1610, 1162, 1233, 3712, 2006, 8336, 7284, 4304, 1070, 21567, 8347, 9929, 1137, 4456, 1066, 3427, 3253, 2059, 1610, 24605, 1250, 1102, 2274, 5099, 12725, 1065, 1040, 8975, 1158, 10174, 28992, 8336, 1245, 6353, 1176, 2374, 1066, 5238, 7732, 8854, 1065, 4396, 1610, 2066, 1220, 8034, 5848, 1761, 11742, 1347, 29492, 17272, 5653, 3515, 2636, 5543, 17206, 1610, 3767, 10432, 6513, 1137, 17637, 1072, 1347, 29492, 17272, 5848, 1422, 1206, 3197, 1757, 5355, 3678, 1040, 11610, 16128, 1070, 4867, 1968, 3260, 22716, 19702, 1448, 18276, 1589, 9202, 1066, 1164, 3703, 8937, 1071, 1610, 2093, 29485, 1941, 29481, 1452, 15447, 1122, 29473, 29518, 29502, 29502, 29542, 8876, 1158, 17898, 13333, 5105, 5868, 1056, 7734, 2080, 3229, 16898, 3645, 1066, 5112, 1065, 9274, 1122, 1420, 27920, 1610, 3725, 10907, 1274, 4931, 8977, 1065, 16620, 1066, 1448, 6662, 17982, 1040, 6361, 3296, 1070, 1420, 6341, 2500, 1265, 1610, 12179, 14447, 12725, 1163, 1401, 3887, 3317, 1968, 1072, 3377, 2006, 1422, 1065, 1947, 6611, 1610, 13274, 1072, 1347, 29492, 17272, 9274, 6738, 2706, 1040, 15206, 3984, 1610, 3761, 1968, 10446, 1142, 1397, 23630, 2077, 20042, 1163, 2254, 6343, 7734, 1610, 1150, 1244, 23630, 4517, 2113, 1245, 5105, 1063, 1244, 9274, 1610, 781, 781, 13360, 17637, 9274, 1085, 2061, 15771, 1894, 1122, 3624, 8279, 1044, 1096, 23630, 17800, 1650, 1516, 1072, 10604, 1509, 1401, 10691, 1066, 1917, 5653, 1610, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29549, 29520], 'total_duration': 2625643600, 'load_duration': 5562100, 'prompt_eval_count': 342, 'prompt_eval_duration': 974366000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1643088000}"
659,"July 23 , 2008 Economic activity in the Seventh District was sluggish in June . Consumer spending was mixed and labor market conditions weakened some , although they continued to vary by location . Residential construction declined further and nonresidential construction showed signs of slowing . Manufacturing activity weakened slightly . Consumer lending declined , while business lending was stable . Cost pressures from rising material and energy prices remained high , while wage pressures continued to be low . Flooding and cool weather further set back crop conditions in June , although they improved toward the end of the month and in early July . Consumer Spending Consumer spending was mixed since the previous reporting period . Federal tax rebates and increased discounting boosted retail sales , but spending on automobiles slowed . Consumers continued to tighten their budgets in response to higher food and energy prices . Spending on discretionary items such as furniture , apparel , and electronics decreased and gasoline consumption fell , while food service sales were flat . Higher fuel prices discouraged travel , leading to a slowdown in tourism . Tourism was also adversely affected by inclement weather and flooding in some areas of the District .

Demand for business loans was relatively stable , while lending to households was flat to declining . Energy production was steady to increasing . And the market for freight transport services has softened . Employment levels were largely unchanged and wage pressures were limited to energy producers . Staffing firms saw a small increase in the number of job openings and job seekers . Job vacancies were greatest in health care and high-skilled manufacturing . Accounts of rising input prices , especially for metals and petroleum-based products , were widespread . However , we heard a few reports that the rate of increase in commodity prices is moderating .

Transportation service contacts in cargo and container trade reported a recent pickup in demand and were hopeful this was a sign that the economy was bottoming out . Still volumes remain well below year-ago levels . Intermodal cargo volumes rose slightly over the past month as export demand improved , and contacts said water-based container trade volume increased . Railroad respondents said volumes declined across the board following a pickup noted in the last survey . The railroad industry outlook remained grim for 2009 , but contacts said it looked like the economy was bouncing along the bottom . Construction and Real Estate Homebuilders reported a slight uptick in sales . Much of the demand is focused on the lower-priced entry-level market , and one large company said the first-time homebuyer tax credit was responsible for about 80 percent of their current business . There was some concern about the November expiration of the program , however , as buyers have just begun to come off the sidelines .

Reduced global demand and lower prices for oil have prompted a sharp cutback in oil extraction activity since last fall , with Dallas noting an `` unprecedented '' decline in the domestic rig count that was largely concentrated in their District . Respondents from the Kansas City District expect oil extraction activity to fall further as the year proceeds , and Minneapolis noted that natural gas and mining activities also faltered during the reporting period . Prices and Wages Upward price pressures were very limited during the reporting period , as a result of lower energy and commodity prices and weak demand for final goods and services across a wide range of sectors . The lower prices of energy and raw materials generally were passed on and contributed to downward pressure on the final prices of various products , according to Chicago and Dallas . Prices dropped on selected retail items in the Philadelphia , Kansas City , and San Francisco Districts , as discounting was widespread . Selected food products were a notable exception to downward price pressures , with Philadelphia reporting that some food processors raised their product prices . Gas prices rose , but according to Chicago and San Francisco the increase was not large enough to substantially offset the ongoing effects of the net decline from last year 's highs .

Upward wage pressures eased in all Districts , as a rising incidence of hiring freezes and continued job cuts increased the degree of labor market slack .

In the New York District , the market for new homes continued to weaken in New Jersey , and the higher-priced housing markets nearest to New York City were characterized as especially weak . While the Minneapolis District reported that late December saw an up-tick in residential sale activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area , it was reportedly driven by foreclosures and short sales . Increased home sale cancellations were common in a few Districts . Contacts in the Dallas District reported that home sale cancellations remained prevalent , in some cases outpacing sales .

That said , many of these plans involve spending outside the United States .

Software and Information Technology Services New England software and information technology services contacts generally report weaker-than-expected activity through October , with revenues in the third quarter roughly on par with year-earlier levels . The downtick in activity reportedly reflects heightened political and economic uncertainty , which has rendered many potential clients unwilling to commit to projects . Many contacts report increasing difficulty in executing large license agreements , particularly in Europe , where one contact says sluggishness in the manufacturing sector led to a year-over-year decline in license revenue of nearly 40 percent .

Delays in contract signings and project starts have led many respondent firms to slow the pace",-0.6,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T20:24:21.9917801Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 29484, 2420, 29473, 29550, 29551, 2333, 1510, 1458, 1358, 1274, 1518, 3710, 1066, 5979, 5776, 1122, 1032, 1811, 1495, 10610, 1072, 1458, 5776, 1358, 1279, 1227, 13363, 1148, 1066, 1115, 3126, 1066, 5979, 1224, 1647, 4618, 10610, 2074, 7604, 1040, 15194, 1066, 1420, 1695, 1122, 5776, 7184, 15554, 15835, 1163, 3716, 7259, 1070, 7034, 1610, 10610, 1098, 18514, 1070, 14073, 1513, 25351, 7876, 13165, 1146, 5776, 13875, 4564, 1066, 2068, 15554, 1673, 1065, 5845, 1610, 10610, 1328, 3720, 1968, 15954, 20843, 1232, 6159, 19056, 1427, 1227, 3551, 4931, 1474, 1066, 5265, 1632, 11651, 2697, 1420, 6333, 27808, 9629, 7168, 1610, 2493, 1541, 1968, 2055, 1070, 1935, 7168, 18284, 10749, 4304, 1040, 3737, 4311, 1610, 2031, 3525, 1968, 1032, 18514, 1070, 8635, 7876, 1117, 10749, 3547, 29473, 29550, 29502, 4921, 1448, 1224, 1647, 1589, 1117, 11610, 1968, 1330, 1312, 1137, 20400, 15425, 1032, 1401, 5868, 1065, 6551, 3521, 6333, 27808, 9629, 1065, 1040, 1268, 29491, 29503, 29491, 1117, 8902, 1124, 13132, 1610, 7351, 1072, 9916, 13279, 8842, 2218, 6551, 4698, 1072, 2639, 6282, 4113, 20843, 7509, 3032, 1246, 5544, 29501, 23786, 29501, 8166, 7123, 1827, 5295, 1968, 1163, 16051, 1907, 1065, 1040, 4776, 9017, 16524, 1124, 1708, 1163, 1647, 29501, 1412, 29482, 1517, 6925, 1610, 1183, 15897, 1449, 1065, 7123, 6513, 1114, 25113, 5878, 2874, 5123, 1072, 7406, 18878, 1968, 1458, 1427, 22563, 2055, 5396, 7587, 13460, 9085, 1066, 6221, 1066, 7796, 1610, 6793, 20843, 3032, 7256, 15194, 1065, 5314, 1056, 3243, 7569, 18088, 1968, 7079, 1065, 4169, 1968, 1738, 1392, 4522, 3395, 1903, 23833, 1557, 2235, 1065, 1040, 15954, 10410, 4931, 1066, 1032, 1647, 29501, 2251, 29501, 5163, 18236, 1065, 7569, 14776, 1070, 6365, 29473, 29549, 29502, 4921, 1610, 781, 781, 10257, 1516, 1065, 5769, 2260, 1510, 1072, 3256, 9151, 1274, 4931, 2055, 10189, 1076, 19021, 1066, 4712, 1040, 14449, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 1155, 29502, 29491, 29552, 29520], 'total_duration': 3000236400, 'load_duration': 5798700, 'prompt_eval_count': 353, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1043748000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1948551000}"

Gains continue among the makers of food products , lumber and wood products , fabricated metals , industrial machinery , and instruments . Firms in the primary metals and electronic equipment industries report a fall-off in demand .

Except for primary metals , optimism is present in all major sectors .

New to the list of concerns and uncertainties about the outlook is the increasing worry that political gridlock will lead to large cuts in defense-related production through sequestration .

750,"February 29 , 2012 Overall , business activity in the Third District has grown at a somewhat faster pace compared with the previous Beige Book . The overall sentiment has been more positive , although the very mild winter weather may have played a part . Since the last Beige Book , manufacturing activity has grown further with more broad sectors contributing to the gain . Retail sales maintained steady year-over-year increases . Motor vehicle dealers experienced unseasonably strong sales growth overall ; however , results varied by state . Third District banks have reported slight growth in lending and continued improvement of credit quality since the last Beige Book . New home construction started the year strong with the warm weather assist . Commercial real estate contacts continued to report steadily improving markets for industrial , retail , and office space . Overall , service-sector firms reported continued growth . Price pressures have remained contained for most sectors , with little change from the last Beige Book . Most firms have expressed a brighter outlook since the last Beige Book . Manufacturers anticipate rising shipments and orders during the next six months . Retailers expect slightly stronger sales , and auto dealers are increasingly confident that the current surge in sales will carry into the spring selling season .

Although it is still well below its historical average , the sales pace for new and existing homes picked up further in many areas , and some contacts pointed to pent-up demand that may spur additional gains . Contacts also reported that the share of foreclosures and short sales in overall home sales has been declining , and the quality of the inventory of available homes has improved .

Demand for nonresidential space was largely stable overall , with construction activity largely limited to various public projects and remodeling of commercial and industrial space . Financial InstitutionsDistrict banking contacts reported that loan demand was unchanged or down slightly on balance compared with the prior reporting period . Business loan demand appeared to drop a bit , amid growing reluctance by many firms to commit to expansion plans under current economic conditions .

According to contacts , slight increases in interest rates will likely spur more buyer activity in the short term as households try to lock in historically low interest rates . In Massachusetts , particularly in the Greater Boston area , inventory levels remain low , placing upward pressure on prices . Contacts in the Greater Boston area caution that inventory remains the most significant constraint on sales growth . In other parts of the First District , smaller cities report depleting inventory levels in urban centers , though realtors in these areas feel that a sufficient number of homes are available to satisfy prospective buyers . In contrast to much of the region , Rhode Island maintains a high level of inventory , but that market appears to be recovering as sales activity and prices continue to increase . Contacts expect sales activity and the median sale price to continue their upward trend . Inventory levels will likely remain an issue in urban areas due to a lack of new construction there . Contacts anticipate that homeowners may be more inclined to list their home for sale as house values continue to appreciate . Overall , contacts feel the market remains poised for healthy growth in the coming months .",0.7,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T20:25:44.1430201Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.7}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 17733, 6241, 1040, 4973, 8975, 1065, 3014, 1610, 3767, 10432, 1065, 1040, 5192, 3032, 3735, 6405, 1122, 12589, 1968, 7079, 1065, 13038, 5788, 1070, 2218, 6551, 1610, 7354, 1066, 20843, 1968, 6311, 12863, 1065, 2913, 8746, 1390, 4685, 1436, 1092, 1448, 25629, 7123, 1065, 1040, 3253, 2618, 1158, 24523, 2232, 1066, 5112, 1065, 5032, 2712, 3627, 2913, 8746, 1610, 1328, 17023, 1968, 7079, 1065, 1040, 10029, 1563, 9911, 3466, 1968, 20698, 6925, 7112, 3627, 1968, 21400, 26014, 7171, 1124, 9274, 1610, 3767, 10432, 1065, 1040, 10029, 1563, 9911, 3466, 27537, 1137, 20698, 8288, 1040, 1848, 6632, 18424, 1124, 7060, 6825, 1610, 1328, 1567, 5867, 1070, 1040, 4973, 8975, 1968, 7768, 10013, 3032, 1108, 1560, 1925, 20698, 6925, 1065, 13038, 18783, 1968, 2838, 2121, 29475, 1502, 1065, 1935, 5788, 2369, 1137, 1032, 10174, 2242, 1070, 9807, 1228, 3400, 1066, 16604, 12218, 1263, 22640, 1610, 1328, 10117, 1066, 1956, 1070, 1040, 5192, 1968, 11050, 1341, 8401, 6152, 2374, 1032, 2254, 2952, 1070, 20698, 1968, 1330, 1137, 3436, 8813, 1066, 1115, 10211, 1056, 1158, 7060, 7123, 1072, 9274, 4456, 1066, 6015, 1610, 3767, 10432, 2443, 7060, 7123, 1072, 1040, 17593, 8564, 4912, 1066, 4456, 1420, 26014, 9924, 1610, 1328, 17685, 6925, 1390, 4685, 7112, 1164, 5059, 1065, 13038, 5788, 3708, 1066, 1032, 6270, 1070, 1401, 7148, 1504, 1610, 3767, 10432, 13363, 1148, 1137, 2379, 25457, 1761, 1115, 1448, 27883, 1066, 2042, 1420, 2379, 1122, 8564, 1158, 2902, 3837, 4456, 1066, 12750, 1610, 21781, 1968, 20843, 2369, 1040, 3436, 8288, 2395, 3226, 1122, 8551, 6825, 1065, 1040, 4292, 4138, 1610, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29555, 29520], 'total_duration': 2606663200, 'load_duration': 5190000, 'prompt_eval_count': 309, 'prompt_eval_duration': 921337000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1677465000}"

Our contacts attributed this trend to low interest rates , favorable prices , and an improving labor market . One builder commented that young people are less inclined to buy a house than were their parents due to a perceived lack of value and a desire for mobility . He believes that this reluctance may put downward pressure on the housing industry for years to come . New home contracts were found mostly in the mid- to higher-price-point categories . Demand for multifamily housing remains strong . Builders expressed confidence that the turnaround in the housing market will persist in the upcoming months . However , they cited difficulty in obtaining financing and low inventory as barriers to more robust growth in their industry . List prices of new homes increased by as much as 10 percent in certain markets this year due primarily to rising construction costs . Builders have cut back on discounting . Nonresidential builders told us that while inquiries have weakened , there were still a large number of projects in the development phase . However , backlogs are lower than what most builders would like . The strongest activity was in multifamily housing , energy , and manufacturing . The office and large-footprint retail segments were relatively weak . Our contacts are cautious about near-term activity .

Furniture sales are down a bit . Some inventories are a bit higher than anticipated . Despite these rather mixed results , contacts continue to believe that the U.S. economy is improving -- one source terms the recent weakness `` just a hiccup . '' Boston hotel revenues were up 4.8 percent year-over-year in 2014 : Q1 . In April , Boston-area hotel occupancy rates were above 90 percent , which is unusually high , and observers say they expect hotel revenues to exceed those posted for April 2013 . Some of this increase is due to business related to the 2014 Marathon , which had almost 36,000 entrants compared to about 17,600 in 2013 . Boston area restaurants also did well in April , although final numbers are not yet in . For 2014 : Q1 , Boston restaurant revenues were up 4.9 percent over 2013 : Q1 -- this breaks down as flat in January , a 3.4 percent increase in February , and a 7.6 percent increase in March .

Contacts in New Hampshire and Rhode Island cite declines in sales of single family homes , while Massachusetts experienced no change , and respondents in Connecticut , Maine , and Vermont cite increases in sales relative to December 2012 . Scarce inventory is said to be the most significant constraint on the growth of sales , while uncertainty from new qualified mortgage rules and flood insurance reforms are also believed to be causing buyers to remain cautious about making offers . Contacts in Connecticut say that sales are being affected by weak consumer confidence and a shortage of stable employment opportunities . Median sale prices increased year-over-year in four of the six New England states , decreasing only in Connecticut and Vermont . In Massachusetts , particularly in the Greater Boston area , price appreciation driven by low inventory levels has become a concern as realtors caution that high prices could keep first time home buyers out of the market .

The travel and tourism sector saw increased activity in January 2015 over January 2014 , but lost business in late January and February because of severe winter weather . The weather conditions also had ripple effects for food suppliers , delivery workers , and wait staff . A contact estimates that restaurant revenues in the Boston area were down 30 percent to 40 percent during this period , reflecting lost traffic from corporate travelers , regional leisure travelers , and weekend business from local residents . Museums and other attractions were down 6 percent for 2015 : Q1 compared to 2014 : Q1 .

826,"One contact noted that the bankruptcy of South Korean shipping company Hanjin ( which left $ 14 billion of cargo stranded at sea due to inability to pay port fees ) should have limited effects on retail inventories . Manufacturing inventories were generally at desired levels . Steel service center inventories were below historical norms , but a contacted noted that this was likely intentional because growth in steel demand has slowed . Current capital expenditures continued to grow at a moderate pace , as did expectations for future spending . Outlays were primarily for replacing industrial and IT equipment . Hiring picked up to a moderate rate , and contacts expect hiring to continue at a moderate rate over the next six to twelve months . Many contacts noted that the labor market continues to tighten . Demand remained strong for skilled workers , particularly for many professional and technical occupations , sales , and skilled manufacturing and building trades . Contacts also indicated that competition continued to grow for lower-skilled workers . A staffing firm again reported no change in billable hours and ongoing difficulty filling orders at the wages employers were willing to pay . The firm noted that turnover rates were high . It also reported an increase in drug test failures relative to a year ago among potential employees .

Demand for electricity increased slightly in the Chicago area , led by an influx of large industrial customers , while demand for electricity fell slightly in the Detroit area .

867,"main issue is a shortage of drivers . Manufacturing respondents had a positive outlook . In general , contacts were increasing capital expenditures , although only one reported a major increase in spending ( to build a new plant in New Hampshire ) . Contacts said that it was too soon to determine the effect of the new tax code on capital spending . Staffing Services New England staffing firms have seen mostly negative results over the last quarter of 2017 and the start of 2018 , with the majority reporting revenue declines year-over-year . For most respondents , this reflects a low unemployment environment that has slowed hiring volumes and increased competition for the remaining labor supply . Some also remarked on the entry of new tech firms specializing in job posting sites , which has made it easier for companies to host job searches without using intermediaries . This has sparked experimentation as they look for ways to distinguish themselves through advertising , branding , improving online reviews , and increased attention to building relationships with potential talent . One respondent reported the temporary placement side of their business was the strongest , while most noted that few workers want temporary positions in the current labor market .

Prices While reports of rising prices are becoming more widespread , on balance , price increases remained modest . Among nonmanufacturing firms , one-third reported increases for prices paid , and less than one-fourth reported increases for prices received – about the same as the prior period . Reports of price increases were more widespread among manufacturing firms this period , with over half noting higher prices paid and over one-third indicating higher prices received for their own goods . Builders continued to report rising prices , particularly for materials containing lumber , steel , and oil derivatives . Several manufacturers ( and their bankers ) cited rising prices for aluminum ingot , steel , and oil – some passed along the costs ; however , margins shrank for others .

Nonauto retail sales , tourist activity , manufacturing , nonfinancial services , and nonresidential leasing markets grew modestly , while little change was noted by contacts from new home construction , existing home sales , and nonresidential construction . Auto sales continued to decline modestly . On balance , employment , wages , and prices continued to grow modestly . The percentage of firms anticipating continued growth over the next six months remained essentially the same ; however , the percentage fell somewhat among manufacturers and rose among nonmanufacturers . Several contacts observed that sentiment appears to be running a bit hotter than tangible signs of production and investment . Employment and Wages Employment continued to grow at a modest pace during the current Beige Book period . Manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms reported ongoing net additions to staff , while average hours worked edged higher over the period for manufacturing firms but fell among nonmanufacturers . On balance , wage growth held steady at a modest pace ; the share of nonmanufacturing firms reporting increases held steady at about one-third . Most banking contacts noted the apparent disconnect between frequent talk of labor shortages and the lack of evidence that wages are rising significantly in response .

Demand for renewable energy , especially electricity , continued to grow compared to electricity generated by coal , gas , or nuclear . Industrial consumption was mostly down in late 2018 due to seasonal factors . Weather and improved efficiencies continued to drive down residential and commercial consumption . Agriculture Agriculture conditions across the District were mixed . Recent reports showed most of the District was drought-free with the exception of parts of south Florida where there were abnormally dry to moderate drought conditions . The USDA designated some counties in Alabama , Florida , Georgia , and Mississippi as natural disaster areas due to damages and losses attributed to Hurricane Michael , Tropical Storm Gordon , and flooding .

In the Providence area , industrial leasing activity remained robust , exceeding expectations , and two-year rent growth in that market was estimated at 33 percent . Office leasing in Providence softened and office asking rents were stable despite a vacancy uptick ; a contact expects effective rents to soften moving forward . In greater Hartford , leasing activity for both office and industrial space was described as very slow but stable . Investment sales were slow across the District . Contacts expect sales to resume in the fall , with the potential for increased demand following declines in long-term Treasury yields and increasingly favorable borrowing conditions . Concerning the outlook , contacts see no risks of overbuilding or overleverage in commercial property in the District . In Boston , the lack of profitability of high-tech firms occupying large blocks of space was cited as a risk factor . Otherwise , respondents expect stable activity . Residential Real Estate Activity in residential real estate markets in the First District moderated in June or July following strong sales results in May . ( Rhode Island , New Hampshire , and Maine reported year-over-year changes from July 2018 to July 2019 , while Massachusetts , Vermont , and Greater Boston reported statistics through June .

For firms that produce components , the costs of `` qualifying '' new suppliers usually exceed the benefits . Indirect costs of the tariffs were also significant . For example , one contact complained about having to hire consultants to change computer systems to track the cost of tariffs . Contacts said the US tariffs and foreign retaliation had weakened demand for their products . Firms that supply electronic components to capital goods manufacturers said investment demand had slowed because firms were delaying capital expenditure plans . One contact said the brief threat to impose 5 percent tariffs on Mexican goods significantly increased uncertainty because it meant that even with an agreement in place , new tariffs were still possible . In general , contacts said they were able to pass the tariff costs onto their customers . One contact reported that previous problems finding trucking capacity had ebbed . Five of seven contacts reported flat or reduced employment . A frozen fish manufacturer said it was unable to find workers .

905,"March 4 , 2020 Summary of Economic Activity First District firms continued to report increases in economic activity heading into 2020 . Retailers reported mixed but mostly positive results , while restaurateurs saw solid revenue gains . Most manufacturers experienced revenue increases ranging from mid single-digit percentages to more than 20 percent , but two respondents cited revenue declines , both attributed in part to disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak in China . Staffing firms continued to report moderate to strong revenue gains , although a couple cited slowing growth or fewer job requests compared with last year . Residential real estate markets remained tight in the region , with inventories of both homes and condos decreasing as sales and prices rose . Commercial real estate markets were mixed across sectors and locations . Outlooks continued to be positive , with the coronavirus and the presidential election cited as risk factors . Employment and Wages Labor markets in the First District remained tight . Retailers noted that minimum wages went up in some states ; those increases , in combination with a generally tight labor market , have pushed up operating costs . Employment increased year-over-year at five contacted manufacturing firms ; headcount was down modestly year-over-year at one manufacturer and flat at four .

Almost all the manufacturers who were actively hiring reported difficulties finding workers for nearly all positions ranging from skilled executive assistants to experienced wood-workers and engineers ; competition was said to be particularly fierce for higher skilled jobs in northern",0.7,"{'model': 'mistral', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T20:33:41.0671009Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.7}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [3, 29473, 3752, 17682, 7406, 22558, 1124, 1032, 1155, 29508, 1066, 29473, 29508, 6425, 1163, 1155, 29508, 2018, 1848, 7855, 1072, 29473, 29508, 1848, 6046, 1122, 3064, 2507, 4348, 6505, 3013, 29491, 5339, 1040, 8188, 1158, 1032, 10060, 1960, 1163, 1032, 2713, 1070, 22558, 1072, 3279, 1880, 29515, 29473, 781, 29523, 1929, 29473, 29549, 1968, 29473, 29518, 29502, 29518, 29502, 24044, 1070, 21219, 24834, 4973, 8975, 19021, 6085, 1066, 3032, 12863, 1065, 7406, 7123, 14341, 1546, 29473, 29518, 29502, 29518, 29502, 1610, 9105, 1382, 1172, 6513, 10198, 1330, 8212, 6046, 3671, 1968, 2080, 7206, 20139, 3440, 7629, 14776, 22490, 1610, 5590, 20013, 9072, 14776, 12863, 23509, 1245, 5493, 3460, 29501, 8613, 1047, 4921, 2059, 1066, 1448, 1589, 29473, 29518, 29502, 4921, 1968, 1330, 1757, 10189, 1556, 23649, 14776, 4568, 2071, 1968, 2328, 26901, 1065, 1512, 1066, 1472, 1319, 2488, 5970, 1066, 1040, 18935, 23165, 26798, 1065, 5845, 1610, 14362, 1056, 19021, 6085, 1066, 3032, 23419, 1066, 3735, 14776, 22490, 1968, 6200, 1032, 5076, 23649, 4712, 1056, 6825, 1210, 16898, 3157, 10596, 7499, 1163, 2200, 1647, 1610, 2760, 28125, 2121, 10258, 12342, 8336, 7743, 1065, 1040, 5192, 1968, 1163, 9950, 3188, 1070, 2328, 9807, 1072, 2844, 1153, 9280, 4474, 1158, 7060, 1072, 9274, 9304, 1610, 25319, 2121, 10258, 12342, 1422, 10198, 3441, 23782, 1072, 12061, 1610, 5423, 6587, 29481, 6085, 1066, 1115, 6046, 1968, 1163, 1040, 18935, 23165, 1072, 1040, 20036, 8305, 23649, 1158, 5391, 9380, 1610, 3697, 9897, 1072, 1162, 2059, 14928, 12342, 1065, 1040, 4973, 8975, 8336, 7743, 1610, 9105, 1382, 1172, 9427, 1137, 8736, 24878, 2836, 1350, 1065, 1509, 5373, 3521, 2163, 12863, 1968, 1065, 10238, 1163, 1032, 7509, 7743, 8347, 3436, 1968, 1274, 9780, 1350, 11281, 7734, 1610, 3697, 9897, 8251, 1647, 29501, 2251, 29501, 5163, 1206, 4127, 29098, 15954, 19021, 3521, 2103, 2882, 1171, 1828, 1736, 19835, 1647, 29501, 2251, 29501, 5163, 1206, 1392, 18514, 1072, 7775, 1206, 3076, 1610, 781, 781, 3475, 3052, 1312, 1040, 20013, 1461, 1422, 19407, 22117, 6513, 20084, 8252, 8201, 1122, 6365, 1312, 9929, 23509, 1245, 21567, 12980, 6799, 2317, 1066, 9072, 5536, 29501, 29024, 1072, 23256, 3521, 9763, 1171, 1541, 1066, 1115, 7079, 27886, 1122, 5105, 21567, 8562, 1065, 13495, 4, 29473, 10598, 17556, 3255, 2032, 29473, 29502, 29491, 29555, 29520], 'total_duration': 2868825400, 'load_duration': 218890000, 'prompt_eval_count': 363, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1106647000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1544317000}"

Business operations increased incrementally , as COVID-19 caseloads remained at relatively low levels throughout the period . As firms recalled more of their workforce , net employment also grew modestly ; however , firms also continued to issue permanent layoffs . Some wage increases were noted among lower-paying jobs . Meanwhile , contacts reported ongoing difficulties attracting workers . Prices edged higher again amid continued spotty price spikes . Firms maintained modestly positive expectations for growth over the next six months ; however , uncertainty is extremely high , as contacts worried about the end of stimulus measures , pending layoffs , and an inevitable rise of evictions , foreclosures , and bankruptcies . Looming over all is the active presence of the coronavirus . Employment and Wages Employment increased modestly overall as firms stepped up hiring and recalling workers ; however , layoffs continued as well . Among firms in our COVID-19 survey , 25 percent reported that they had hired new workers in July , and 13 percent recalled furloughed workers . Meanwhile , about 6 percent of the firms had laid off workers permanently , and another 6 percent had furloughed workers .

However , at mid-August , a slightly greater percentage of firms reported that employment had declined over the month than had increased .

Growth in the manufacturing and nonfinancial services sectors picked up in early February after stalling in January , while retail activity remained flat . Unprecedented winter storms and widespread power outages in mid-February severely disrupted economic activity , though the impact is mostly expected to be transitory . The housing market continued to be a bright spot , with vigorous new home construction . Overall loan volume decreased slightly , though real estate lending continued to rise . Energy activity improved further . Employment rose and wages increased moderately . Marked price increases were seen in the manufacturing and retail sectors , due in part to supply chain disruptions . Outlooks were generally positive , but uncertainty persisted . Employment and Wages Employment was up overall , with solid hiring continuing in manufacturing and service-sector hiring picking up in February after easing in January . Employment reports were mixed in the energy sector , with some reporting lingering layoffs and others reporting hiring to meet needs for drilling and completion activity .

933,"March 3 , 2021 Summary of Economic Activity On balance , business activity in the Third District rebounded to a modest pace of growth during the current Beige Book period – the first significant growth since midsummer . However , activity in most sectors remained below levels observed prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic . Net employment appeared to rise slightly after falling slightly in the prior period . Positive wage and price growth trends increased to modest and moderate paces , respectively . Economic gains appeared to reflect waning COVID-19 cases and the relaxation of some business restrictions . However , firms continued to cite disruptions at production sites , consumer outlets , and along supply chains . Moreover , wintry weather conditions have constrained growth in several sectors . More than half of the firms expressed positive expectations for modest growth over the next six months – the percent broadened further among nonmanufacturing firms but narrowed among manufacturers . Employment and Wages Employment appeared to increase slightly overall – rebounding from a slight decrease in the prior period . The share of nonmanufacturing firms reporting employment increases for full-time employees just edged out those reporting decreases . Among the manufacturers , employment increases broadened to nearly one-third of the reporting firms , while reported job declines waned . Moreover , average hours worked rose for a larger share of all firms .

Many firms commented that employee turnover was high for various reasons , including a greater desire to work remotely , receive higher wages , change careers , or find better working conditions . One university representative expressed great concern that educators were leaving the profession in large numbers because the current work environment was `` not what they had signed up for . '' Generally , contacts saw few reasons to believe labor supply will soon improve meaningfully . Reports of wage increases were widespread across sectors as firms struggled with the scarcity of workers . Contacts indicated that recent pay raises were often in the high single-digit or low double-digit percentages and that wage pressures were broad across the pay scale . Despite substantial pay raises , contacts had mixed results in attracting or retaining workers . A few staffing agents expected wage growth for lower-paid workers to slow in the coming year , saying that businesses can not afford to pay much more . However , contacts expect wage pressures for higher-skilled workers to remain elevated . Prices Nonlabor input costs rose for most contacts . In a few instances , contacts noted that some costs , such as for steel , had stabilized or come down somewhat . However , such reports were the exceptions .

Manufacturing Manufacturing orders increased slightly from already high levels . Contacts noted that output was stifled by shortages of raw materials and workers . Aerospace equipment manufacturing continued to recover , but auto suppliers said that carmakers purchased less than they had expected because of shortages of microchips and other parts . High staff turnover and rising wages prompted some firms to spend more on labor-saving technology .

Real Estate and Construction Housing demand remained strong despite rising home prices . One homebuilder compared current housing demand to a fever and noted that customers were buying houses at any price without pushback . An increasing number of homebuilders noted that demand has been so strong that they no longer have the capacity to build spec homes .

Discretionary and more interest rate sensitive consumption categories – such as travel and car purchases – declined at a rapid pace , while spending on non-discretionary consumption categories – such as food , energy , and healthcare – increased modestly . Community Conditions Low to moderate income ( LMI ) households in the Tenth District reported greater difficulty securing adequate childcare over the past few months . Contacts cited both a lack of availability and rising costs at childcare facilities as the major barriers faced by households seeking care . Insufficient childcare availability and unaffordability continued to hinder workforce participation among LMI households . Recent policy efforts to improve childcare availability – for example , a recent zoning reform in Wichita , Kansas increased maximum home daycare capacity from 10 to 12 children – have reportedly been more than offset by an acceleration of closures of childcare facilities . Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Manufacturing businesses reported that overall activity remained mostly unchanged over the past few weeks . Higher prices supported revenues , but measures of real activity , including production , backlogs , and new orders , declined moderately .

Durable goods manufacturers reported more severe declines in production and expectations . Growth among services businesses was mixed across sectors .

Furthermore , multiple contacts noted they focused on lending to existing customers and became more prudent in lending to new customers . Real Estate and Construction Homebuilders reported steady sales following an unexpected uptick in the prior period . Contacts continued to attribute the recent improvement to incentives , discounts on older inventory , and new homes built with smaller footprints and lower-cost features . Existing home sales fell slightly from already low levels in most markets – following a moderate decline in the prior period . Contacts noted that the lack of new listings and the continued decline in housing affordability meant the normally busy spring housing market may fail to materialize . Requests for assistance with housing and utility bills fell but continued to dominate the share of 211 requests in New Jersey and Pennsylvania . Almost 32 percent of all requests in the two states were related to housing , while 27 percent of the requests regarded utility bills .

The decline in import volume was mainly due less consumer goods coming into the port . Exports were flat this period .

Empties were still moving and containers were flowing smoothly at the ports ; turn times were good and container dwell times had returned to normal . Demand for airfreight was soft this period ; there was an especially sharp decline in international airfreight , both in terms of exports and imports . Trucking firms reported that underlying demand was flat this period . However , capacity decreased due to several trucking companies shutting down .

On a year-over-year basis , revenues increased by moderate to large margins for all firms . Those latter growth rates were about on par with those of the previous quarter and exceeded expectations in one case . Furthermore , the growth was attributed to factors that had boosted real demand , such as the transition to subscription-based business models . Capital and technology spending was unchanged , and no future changes were anticipated . Contacts expected demand to hold fairly steady at strong levels in the next quarter . One contact noted that the time required to close deals had increased of late , although the implications for their revenues were not yet clear . Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate activity in the First District increased slightly on balance since February .

Some business services firms said they will be raising rates in 2024 after a period of holding back , with one saying , `` [ We ] held rates at 2019 levels through 2023 . '' Consumer Spending Consumer spending increased slightly following a decrease during the prior reporting period . Multiple general merchandisers and one apparel retailer cited strong sales centered on discounted items , while restauranteurs and food retailers reported mostly steady sales through the holiday season . By contrast , auto dealers continued to report slow sales because of high interest rates and high vehicle prices . One large general merchandiser said that lower-income households had become more reliant on credit cards and `` buy now , pay later '' payment options in recent months and was skeptical that these customers could sustain their current level of spending once seasonal promotions ended .

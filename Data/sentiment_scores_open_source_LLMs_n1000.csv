1,"June 17 , 1970 Summary of Findings Sixth District directors have mixed opinions about future business conditions . If any consensus exists , it is that the economy has not yet bottomed out and that recovery will be less than spectacular when it comes . According to directors ' reports and other sources of information , further weakening in sales , employment and production is likely . Department stores report lower volume and growing resistance to higher priced merchandise . Belt tightening by businesses has spread , and directors report many instances of slowdowns in capital spending . Employment and production cutbacks are common . Retail sales Department stores surveyed report no discernible shift from the `` upstairs '' to the `` bargain basement '' . However , customer resistance to higher priced brands has increased , with lower priced merchandise receiving the benefit . A canvass of merchants by one of our Branch offices indicated that they expect no improvement in sales within the near future . Regarding auto sales , distributors contacted report some shifting from larger cars to the compact sized , loaded with optional equipment . Rather than settling for a stripped-down version of a full-sized car , customers are purchasing lower priced equipment-packed models .

2,"of jewelry manufacturers in southern Massachusetts and northern Rhode Island report that 1970 sales levels to date are brisk . The textile industry , concentrated in the same area , has experienced a dramatic increase in demand for products associated with home sewing , reflecting the heightened consumer cost consciousness noted elsewhere this year . The New England machine tool industry , on the other hand , continues in a severely depressed situation with no letup in sight . Several regional producers of chemical and mineral inputs into housing associated products ( e.g. , paints , carpets , linoleum , etc . ) now discern a turnaround in demand as having occurred four to eight weeks ago . Regional labor markets , as noted in earlier reports , are softer than they have been for some years . This easing apparently extends into both blue- and white-collar groups . The views of our academic consultants have perhaps converged same since earlier in the summer . Professor Paul Samuelson feels certain that the economic turnaround is behind us , and that the slowdown has been sufficiently mild that it will escape official NBER designation as a recession . '' As a weak contraction tends to be followed by a sluggish expansion , Samuelson expressed concern that the existent real GNP gap will widen further over the next four quarters .

Price increases for durable goods continue to be about as numerous as in recent months , and there is no clear evidence of a diminution of the rate of rise of prices of finished goods . Rising costs and unsatisfactory volume are causing transportation firms to push regulatory authorities for appreciable increases in rates in hopes of improving earnings . Job markets continue to soften as indicated by unemployment compensation claims , and reports of restricted hiring practices . Increasingly , skilled workers such as machinists , teachers , and other professional types are listed among those seeking work . Lists of unfilled job openings are the smallest since the early Sixties . Despite the improved labor supply picture , wage and pension demands continue large and are backed by militant worker organizations in state and local governments as well as in factories , utilities , and transportation companies . Local strikes are frequent and prolonged .

6,"July 15 , 1970 Economic activity in the Fourth District improved in June , partly reflecting the termination of major strikes . The results of our most recent survey of manufacturers indicate that a more than usual seasonal decline in business conditions may develop in July in the district , although the bunching of plant-wide shutdowns for vacations at this time of year makes the data unusually difficult to interpret . Our directors remain generally pessimistic about the near-term economic outlook , although some of the industrialists feel that economic conditions may be a little better now than in previous months . In response to our question about price developments , we received a few reports of price discounting , but the consensus of our directors and a limited sample of business economists in the district was that prices will remain firm because of strong upward wage pressures . The improvement in economic conditions in the district in June was largely the result of the resumption of production and shipments following work stoppages in the area . The seasonally adjusted rate of insured unemployment for the district declined in June , and at month-end was approximately halfway between the pre-trucking strike level of March and the peak reached in mid-May . Steel ingot production in the district recovered in June after having declined in April and May .

In comparison with the 1969 holiday season , the majority of retailers reported that they expect a heavier volume of sales this year . Three of the retailers expected a substantially heavier volume , eleven expected a slightly heavier volume , seven expected sales to be about the same as in the 1969 season , while only three felt sales might be slightly lighter this year . In the way of general comments , one retailer noted that consumer sentiment was low due to the economic situation but expected relief during the fourth quarter and early in 1971 . One noted that if the General Motors strike continued , plus the massive layoffs at Texas Instruments , Ling-Temco-Vought , General Dynamics and Ford , that holiday sales could be softer than are now anticipated . One retailer indicated he was taking a `` lean bull '' position and expected October through April to be very strong for retail sales .",0.45,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:25:53.8771183Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.45\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 1333, 287, 29899, 6341, 414, 526, 1407, 9543, 310, 8666, 13888, 472, 445, 931, 869, 512, 10230, 411, 278, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29953, 29929, 8753, 22394, 4259, 1919, 278, 13638, 310, 3240, 737, 414, 8967, 393, 896, 2149, 263, 14200, 631, 7977, 310, 16538, 445, 1629, 869, 12753, 310, 278, 3240, 737, 414, 3806, 263, 23228, 368, 14200, 631, 7977, 1919, 28121, 3806, 263, 10029, 14200, 631, 7977, 1919, 9881, 3806, 16538, 304, 367, 1048, 278, 1021, 408, 297, 278, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29953, 29929, 4259, 1919, 1550, 871, 2211, 7091, 16538, 1795, 367, 10029, 301, 14643, 445, 1629, 869, 512, 278, 982, 310, 2498, 6589, 1919, 697, 3240, 737, 261, 11682, 393, 21691, 19688, 471, 4482, 2861, 304, 278, 17407, 6434, 541, 3806, 18892, 2645, 278, 11582, 12616, 322, 4688, 297, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29896, 869, 3118, 11682, 393, 565, 278, 4593, 7142, 943, 21283, 7572, 1919, 2298, 278, 20364, 6568, 22450, 472, 10319, 2799, 582, 1860, 1919, 365, 292, 29899, 5776, 1111, 29899, 29963, 1774, 1919, 4593, 22554, 1199, 322, 14601, 1919, 393, 8753, 22394, 16538, 1033, 367, 577, 906, 1135, 526, 1286, 23483, 630, 869, 3118, 3240, 737, 261, 18694, 540, 471, 5622, 263, 4954, 20793, 289, 913, 6629, 2602, 322, 3806, 5533, 1549, 3786, 304, 367, 1407, 4549, 363, 3240, 737, 16538, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 29871, 29900, 29889, 29946, 29945, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 1025754300, 'load_duration': 4669500, 'prompt_eval_count': 269, 'prompt_eval_duration': 237732000, 'eval_count': 16, 'eval_duration': 782305000}",0.55,0.5,0.2,0.25,0.5
8,"October 14 , 1970 There is evidence that future growth in large CD 's at Tenth District banks will be less . There are indications also that business loan demand may be easing slightly . The labor situation in the Kansas City area has worsened as the construction strike—now in its seventh month—continues and the General Motors strike prevails at several large GM assembly plants . The reduction in output of feed grains and high feed-grain prices is likely to have an impact on the WPI and CPI within several months . Instead of providing a downward pressure on these indices which occurred from March to August , farm prices may again exert upward pressure later this year or early next year . Those large District banks which have actively sought large CD 's ( many have not ) have continued to attract substantial amounts of funds . Growth rates of outstanding CD 's have been comparable to those at large banks in New York City and Chicago . One peculiarity in the Tenth District has been that a significant amount of CD funds have come from state and local governmental units—about one-third of the total growth in CD 's . This source of funds would seem to be limited , so that future growth of CD 's may slow . Despite the rapid growth of CD ' s , most of the District banks so far have retained bank-affiliate commercial paper as a source of funds .

With the recent difficulties in the mid-east , tanker rates have increased by as much as 300 per cent , and imported crude now sells at about 75 cents per barrel above domestic crude on the east coast . Thus , domestic crude prices are under pressure , and at least one oil company has announced price increases in the Tenth District . Business is slow for District farm implement dealers . Inventories are relatively large , and cases of price cutting are not uncommon . Collections on credit sales are reported to be noticeably slower than last year . The interrelatedness of Tenth District economic activity with both national and international business conditions is illustrated by the experience of a Kansas City manufacturer of bottling and automatic vending equipment . This firm 's total business is about unchanged from a year ago , with increasing international business about offsetting a definite decline in domestic sales . The decline in domestic sales is attributed to reduced overtime and lower employment in factories with vending machines , as vending machine operators drop routes and defer the purchase of new equipment . There is some concern within the firm that their growing international business will be hurt by retaliations against U. S. restrictions on imports .

If his expectation is borne out , GM dealers in the District will probably run short of parts and new autos , as inventory shortages are already becoming apparent . The Northwest Airlines strike is also having scattered effects throughout the District . A few firms servicing Northwest Airlines have furloughed employees , and a number of retail establishments have experienced noticeable sales reductions . In addition , Northwest Airlines has cut their flight schedules because of the strike , and as a result landing fees to a number of airports in the District have been drastically reduced . These landing fees are important contributions to airport sinking funds , and in at least one case so far , these reductions have become especially troublesome . Ninth District bankers are still experiencing strong demands for loanable funds , according to information gathered during go-around sessions with both directors and officers of this bank . The continued strong loan demand seems to be general throughout the District as no one cited a case where loan demand had diminished . On the contrary , numerous instances were cited where demand had actually strengthened and non-financial businesses had taken further steps to economize on the use of funds .

However , reports from the steel industry in the Cleveland District reveal that the release of steel stockpiled for General Motors has so far been smaller than expected .

While the liquidity positions of financial institutions are reported to have improved , the consensus of the reports is that loan demand remains weak . In some Districts this is reported to have led to greater investment in municipal securities by banks , and there is some speculation about the possibility of an imminent cut in the prime rate .

Most directors and other business leaders were less than enthusiastic over the use of wage and price controls . However , several were relatively open minded toward this approach , while many of the respondents felt additional action on the part of the Administration to limit further wage and price increases was needed . The Chairman of the electrical equipment manufacturer reported that the Business Council , which he headed until recently , had made it clear to President Nixon that Council Members do n't want wage and price controls because they are convinced they will never work . One director , however , commented that the time was approaching when wage and price controls must be adopted , and another director felt that , while controls would not be workable over any extended period , such controls might have a useful psychological effect for a short period .

Surveys conducted by directors of the Nashville Branch indicate adamant opposition to any type of incomes policy .

Most of the respondents reported a 1- to 2-per cent gain , though a store in Birmingham indicated that it experienced a 10 per cent decline . However , this was largely attributed to a construction strike that has now been settled .

The one exception to this general experience is in boating , where dealers are expecting a tremendous boat year in 1972 and are ordering accordingly . These orders are , however , based on expectations , not actual sales experience . Capital goods producers described business as sluggish in all lines except office and public construction . In some cases directors noted a recent deterioration in orders . One director said that he had just become aware that in the container machinery field , customers were cutting back their capital budgets . Another director felt that the recent downturn in capital goods orders was a result of uncertainties about investment tax credit . Sales of intermediate products to the industrial sector were variously described as sluggish to poor , especially among suppliers to the aerospace and chemical industries . Only one director mentioned that one of his plants was continuing to decrease employment .

One director noted less foreign competition in the construction material market , in part due to the surcharge , in part to a new buy-American feeling inspired by the President",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:26:01.174991Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 25363, 1096, 29871, 29896, 29900, 1919, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29896, 8680, 1513, 943, 12266, 393, 1009, 21691, 5381, 338, 3133, 292, 304, 11157, 17768, 2486, 1919, 322, 297, 263, 2846, 3454, 6683, 562, 1070, 368, 1919, 1550, 1009, 7483, 22535, 5381, 338, 1603, 3755, 2243, 12981, 728, 869, 6213, 310, 1749, 1513, 943, 18860, 6133, 377, 6544, 744, 26094, 515, 1009, 1462, 27801, 869, 8660, 3460, 515, 278, 16538, 27482, 310, 1749, 1513, 943, 525, 13734, 1516, 21691, 805, 2548, 338, 17768, 2486, 2253, 1919, 541, 727, 338, 694, 10757, 310, 263, 1321, 5414, 805, 929, 869, 450, 697, 3682, 304, 445, 2498, 7271, 338, 297, 1045, 1218, 1919, 988, 5376, 414, 526, 16120, 263, 14586, 355, 681, 13006, 1629, 297, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29906, 322, 526, 20520, 16205, 869, 4525, 11299, 526, 1919, 3138, 1919, 2729, 373, 2149, 800, 1919, 451, 3935, 16538, 7271, 869, 25343, 22535, 1391, 22543, 5439, 5381, 408, 2243, 12981, 728, 297, 599, 3454, 5174, 8034, 322, 970, 7632, 869, 512, 777, 4251, 1513, 943, 11682, 263, 7786, 270, 1308, 1611, 362, 297, 11299, 869, 3118, 8881, 1497, 393, 540, 750, 925, 4953, 9543, 393, 297, 278, 5639, 7672, 262, 708, 1746, 1919, 20330, 892, 28967, 1250, 1009, 7483, 8619, 20078, 869, 7280, 8881, 7091, 393, 278, 7786, 16611, 593, 595, 297, 7483, 22535, 11299, 471, 263, 1121, 310, 443, 6327, 2365, 583, 1048, 13258, 358, 8818, 16200, 869, 28389, 310, 19697, 9316, 304, 278, 18408, 17535, 892, 5164, 368, 5439, 408, 2243, 12981, 728, 304, 6460, 1919, 7148, 4249, 1462, 27801, 304, 278, 263, 9672, 3535, 322, 22233, 6397, 2722, 869, 9333, 697, 8881, 5276, 393, 697, 310, 670, 18577, 471, 3133, 292, 304, 23806, 5703, 358, 869, 13, 13, 6716, 8881, 11682, 3109, 9117, 13888, 297, 278, 7632, 5518, 9999, 1919, 297, 760, 2861, 304, 278, 1190, 23367, 1919, 297, 760, 304, 263, 716, 15649, 29899, 14689, 11223, 20603, 491, 278, 7178, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 818559400, 'load_duration': 2003600, 'prompt_eval_count': 372, 'prompt_eval_duration': 327384000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 488143000}",0.4,0.3,0.2,0.25,0.5

The outlook for the regional economy was also largely unchanged by announcement of the Phase II outline . Eighteen of the directors currently foresee a moderate increase in activity in their local areas , as compared with 14 earlier .

Earlier , directors were somewhat less optimistic about prices . Commercial banking directors were also surveyed on their outlook for money and capital market rates and the commercial bank prime lending rate . Nine of the 14 commercial bankers now believe that short-term rates will decline moderately .

Prior to the announcement of Phase II , ten of the respondents thought rates would remain essentially unchanged",-0.25,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:26:02.6150812Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": -0.25\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 2887, 363, 278, 2198, 714, 6914, 363, 26094, 1919, 1048, 1023, 29899, 22585, 29879, 310, 278, 1513, 943, 2149, 393, 17768, 403, 16415, 674, 6403, 1919, 322, 278, 17346, 23483, 403, 393, 26094, 674, 3933, 13674, 443, 15033, 869, 28609, 278, 1963, 559, 1944, 1824, 471, 1754, 970, 1919, 1048, 697, 29899, 17823, 386, 310, 278, 1513, 943, 892, 16120, 23228, 16415, 297, 26094, 1919, 4203, 892, 23483, 1218, 17768, 403, 16415, 1919, 322, 278, 1791, 892, 3063, 363, 2217, 1735, 869, 6549, 1919, 278, 1136, 8841, 310, 1513, 943, 1919, 491, 263, 2319, 13638, 1919, 338, 393, 278, 11265, 310, 278, 14617, 322, 20743, 1952, 3163, 26371, 2925, 278, 27289, 363, 7621, 8666, 25806, 869, 450, 714, 6914, 363, 278, 14014, 26504, 471, 884, 18425, 443, 15033, 491, 7475, 13561, 310, 278, 1963, 559, 1944, 27887, 869, 382, 1141, 9404, 310, 278, 1513, 943, 5279, 363, 968, 29872, 263, 17768, 403, 7910, 297, 6354, 297, 1009, 1887, 10161, 1919, 408, 9401, 411, 29871, 29896, 29946, 8859, 869, 450, 7475, 13561, 8581, 694, 10551, 362, 297, 278, 1513, 943, 525, 24809, 358, 310, 278, 27289, 29879, 363, 278, 443, 3451, 22812, 6554, 297, 1009, 1887, 10161, 869, 3387, 975, 4203, 892, 313, 322, 1603, 526, 1723, 23483, 1218, 263, 17768, 403, 4845, 457, 297, 278, 443, 3451, 22812, 6554, 869, 450, 1513, 943, 4658, 393, 26094, 674, 7636, 701, 1328, 10029, 297, 278, 6474, 869, 5290, 4926, 1919, 1513, 943, 892, 10579, 3109, 5994, 4695, 1048, 26094, 869, 422, 1050, 1455, 9124, 292, 1513, 943, 892, 884, 18994, 287, 373, 1009, 714, 6914, 363, 6909, 322, 7483, 9999, 19257, 322, 278, 12128, 9124, 6019, 301, 2548, 6554, 869, 405, 457, 310, 278, 29871, 29896, 29946, 12128, 9124, 414, 1286, 4658, 393, 3273, 29899, 8489, 19257, 674, 4845, 457, 17768, 2486, 869, 13, 13, 29925, 13479, 304, 278, 7475, 13561, 310, 1963, 559, 1944, 1919, 3006, 310, 278, 10049, 1237, 2714, 19257, 723, 3933, 13674, 443, 15033, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29908, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29906, 29945, 13, 29913], 'total_duration': 775204400, 'load_duration': 4369600, 'prompt_eval_count': 377, 'prompt_eval_duration': 326853000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 444480000}",0.4,0.5,0.3,0.6,0.3

Since retail sales are so important at this time of year and consumer spending is being closely watched as a clue to economic growth in 1971 , district retail stores were again surveyed this month . Reports were mixed—with some department stores and discount houses reporting a decline in sales during December , as compared with the same month last year ; while others reported gains , mostly of a modest nature . After having generally good sales in November , several stores reported that sales in early December were disappointing but then improved substantially again just before Christmas . Weather conditions may have been partly responsible for this pattern . Generally , stores that had the best gains were the large combination mail order-department stores . One regional controller of a chain of such stores said that their sales usually hold up quite well during economic slowdowns when customers are interested in good quality at reasonable prices . Somewhat surprisingly , a large store that specializes in luxury gift items and caters to above-average income customers reported sales this fall increased by about 10 per cent . Generally , stores that had strong sales just before Christmas also report strong post-Christmas sales , while stores with weak pre-Christmas sales continue to exhibit weak sales .

The surveyed retail stores were also asked whether they had used any extra promotional activities such as intensified advertising campaigns or earlier price reductions this year due to the economic slowdown",-0.2,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:26:04.2488081Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.2\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 328, 874, 873, 15201, 491, 3151, 18237, 358, 310, 10354, 318, 661, 1974, 10596, 2129, 869, 4001, 3240, 737, 16538, 526, 577, 4100, 472, 445, 931, 310, 1629, 322, 21691, 805, 2548, 338, 1641, 16467, 20654, 408, 263, 23960, 304, 17407, 14321, 297, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29896, 1919, 6474, 3240, 737, 14422, 892, 1449, 18994, 287, 445, 4098, 869, 830, 4011, 892, 12849, 30003, 2541, 777, 14311, 14422, 322, 2313, 792, 12955, 23415, 263, 4845, 457, 297, 16538, 2645, 5846, 1919, 408, 9401, 411, 278, 1021, 4098, 1833, 1629, 2056, 1550, 4045, 8967, 330, 2708, 1919, 11149, 310, 263, 878, 342, 5469, 869, 2860, 2534, 6892, 1781, 16538, 297, 3979, 1919, 3196, 14422, 8967, 393, 16538, 297, 4688, 5846, 892, 23451, 292, 541, 769, 16710, 23228, 368, 1449, 925, 1434, 17661, 869, 1334, 1624, 5855, 1122, 505, 1063, 22669, 14040, 363, 445, 4766, 869, 3251, 635, 1919, 14422, 393, 750, 278, 1900, 330, 2708, 892, 278, 2919, 10296, 10524, 1797, 29899, 311, 8076, 14422, 869, 3118, 14014, 4701, 310, 263, 9704, 310, 1316, 14422, 1497, 393, 1009, 16538, 5491, 4808, 701, 3755, 1532, 2645, 17407, 5232, 3204, 29879, 746, 20330, 526, 8852, 297, 1781, 11029, 472, 15590, 26094, 869, 3834, 5816, 26800, 368, 1919, 263, 2919, 3787, 393, 4266, 7093, 297, 21684, 2857, 19797, 4452, 322, 6635, 414, 304, 2038, 29899, 12483, 482, 17869, 20330, 8967, 16538, 445, 6416, 11664, 491, 1048, 29871, 29896, 29900, 639, 1644, 869, 3251, 635, 1919, 14422, 393, 750, 4549, 16538, 925, 1434, 17661, 884, 3461, 4549, 1400, 29899, 18687, 8247, 16538, 1919, 1550, 14422, 411, 8062, 758, 29899, 18687, 8247, 16538, 6773, 304, 10371, 277, 8062, 16538, 869, 13, 13, 1576, 18994, 287, 3240, 737, 14422, 892, 884, 4433, 3692, 896, 750, 1304, 738, 4805, 2504, 327, 1848, 14188, 1316, 408, 12838, 2164, 18811, 5921, 11531, 29879, 470, 8859, 8666, 3724, 1953, 445, 1629, 2861, 304, 278, 17407, 5232, 3204, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29906, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 814966600, 'load_duration': 4601000, 'prompt_eval_count': 368, 'prompt_eval_duration': 325776000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 483909000}",0.4,0.3,-0.2,0.25,0.2

One report , however , indicated that small businesses had held down , or delayed , raises due to difficulty in interpreting Phase II guidelines . The only adverse impact of Phase II reported by another director was that the time spent by businessmen in interpreting Phase II rules had kept managers away from more productive endeavors .

The directors also felt that the implementation of Phase II has not adversely influenced consumer sentiment in the District , and they reported that District retailers expect their sales to improve .

In contrast to the generally weak business loan demand in other parts of the country , the demand for business loans in the ninth district appears to be quite strong . Conversations with three reserve city bankers revealed that the rise in their business loans is stronger than they had anticipated , and some of these people felt that the recent cuts in the prime rate were unjustified , at least for their banks . One Director , who is also the president of a reserve city bank , said that although he keeps expecting his bank 's outstanding loan balances to fall , they keep rising to new highs . He feels that a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that his national customers have tended to ignore the corporate bond market as a source of debt funds and instead are relying on banks for their borrowings . Three other Directors from rural areas in the district also felt that loan demand was picking up . Although they were not sure of the reasons for the strengthening , they were able to cite instances pointing to a rise in loan demand . One South Dakota Director said , for example , that a number of banks in his area had dropped out of participation pools because they were able to use all their loanable funds for local borrowers .

25,"in the former case , the increase is a recovery from the strike- induced slump . The lack of strong demand is reflected in automobile production . General Motors has reduced overtime schedules and the other automobile producers are operating at reduced levels . Manufacturing shows no sign of a general recovery . There are industries which report a rise in output ( containers , furniture , steel , some machine tools , and textiles ) , but other industries are still retrenching . Although major layoffs of workers are occurring less often , companies are continuing to reduce their workforces through attrition or unpaid holidays . Increased hiring is still not widespread . Investment plans similarly are restrained and expenditures on capital equipment in 1971 are expected to be at about the same level as last year . Even rising new orders for steel are not a reflection of an upturn in the economy but rather represent hedging against either a steel strike or further price rises . According to steel industry economists , overall production for this year will not be above last year . There is one sector which has favorable prospects for recovery .

Manufacturers are cautiously optimistic compared with the fact that no change was foreseen a month ago . The Cleveland Bank reports that new steel orders have increased sharply since mid-December . Furthermore , steel industry economists expect a big pickup in steel shipments to begin about March and the second quarter to be much stronger than the first . Much of this anticipated gain is based on rising demand in preparation for a steel strike . The Richmond Bank reported an increase in manufacturers ' inventories . With the exception of the steel companies , however , manufacturers generally do not indicate great gains in sales expectations . In conformity with this view , some layoffs and plant closings have recently occurred in the electronics and TV industries . Most Reserve banks indicate that the current high rate of unemployment is likely to continue for several months . Further declines in employment , however , are not expected as most reports indicate that the retrenchment process of firms is about complete .

28,"August 18 , 1971 The pessimism regarding the economic outlook that had been expressed by the directors of the New York Bank and of the Buffalo Branch last month was still evident , and perhaps intensified , this month ( before the Administration announced its new measures ) . In general , the assessment was for no significant change in consumer attitudes , while some directors believed there had been an actual scaling back of buying intentions ; business inventory spending was not expected to strengthen in the near future ; no noticeable improvement in labor market conditions was foreseen and most of the directors felt that a general economic upturn would gain momentum later than had been generally expected . Concerning consumer spending , the Buffalo Branch directors viewed retail sales activity as relatively better than a year ago , but with no discernible trend either up or down . The New York Branch directors were somewhat more pessimistic . A director from Rochester had had recent discussions with a cross section of New York City department store executives , who reported a slowdown in consumer spending in recent weeks and were generally pessimistic regarding the immediate future . The chairman of the board of a nationwide manufacturing concern believed that consumers were exhibiting caution and more selectivity regarding both price and quality , and saw consumer reluctance showing up particularly in discretionary spending , such as that for travel .

Other directors also thought there had been a scaling back in consumer buying plans",-0.6,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:26:09.3565087Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.6\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 26197, 29871, 29896, 29947, 1919, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29896, 450, 282, 404, 326, 1608, 11211, 278, 17407, 714, 6914, 393, 750, 1063, 13384, 491, 278, 1513, 943, 310, 278, 1570, 3088, 10253, 322, 310, 278, 22274, 7003, 25889, 1833, 4098, 471, 1603, 13602, 1919, 322, 6060, 12838, 2164, 1919, 445, 4098, 313, 1434, 278, 23303, 9326, 967, 716, 15366, 1723, 869, 512, 2498, 1919, 278, 24809, 358, 471, 363, 694, 7282, 1735, 297, 21691, 1098, 20816, 1919, 1550, 777, 1513, 943, 13112, 727, 750, 1063, 385, 3935, 21640, 1250, 310, 1321, 5414, 7609, 1080, 2056, 5381, 11817, 706, 805, 2548, 471, 451, 3806, 304, 9324, 264, 297, 278, 2978, 5434, 2056, 694, 8369, 519, 20414, 297, 10212, 9999, 5855, 471, 363, 968, 264, 322, 1556, 310, 278, 1513, 943, 7091, 393, 263, 2498, 17407, 318, 415, 595, 723, 11581, 19399, 2678, 1135, 750, 1063, 6892, 3806, 869, 23924, 824, 292, 21691, 805, 2548, 1919, 278, 22274, 7003, 25889, 1513, 943, 24774, 3240, 737, 16538, 6354, 408, 13774, 2253, 1135, 263, 1629, 8020, 1919, 541, 411, 694, 2313, 824, 1821, 534, 355, 2845, 701, 470, 1623, 869, 450, 1570, 3088, 25889, 1513, 943, 892, 10579, 901, 282, 404, 326, 4695, 869, 319, 8881, 515, 1528, 10530, 750, 750, 7786, 5353, 1080, 411, 263, 4891, 4004, 310, 1570, 3088, 4412, 14311, 3787, 6704, 3145, 1919, 1058, 8967, 263, 5232, 3204, 297, 21691, 805, 2548, 297, 7786, 11405, 322, 892, 6892, 282, 404, 326, 4695, 11211, 278, 16800, 5434, 869, 450, 28942, 310, 278, 7613, 310, 263, 5233, 8157, 12012, 3864, 5932, 13112, 393, 11233, 414, 892, 10371, 11407, 5777, 918, 322, 901, 1831, 2068, 11211, 1716, 8666, 322, 11029, 1919, 322, 4446, 21691, 1104, 5313, 749, 6445, 701, 10734, 297, 766, 4838, 291, 653, 805, 2548, 1919, 1316, 408, 393, 363, 9850, 869, 13, 13, 16107, 1513, 943, 884, 2714, 727, 750, 1063, 263, 21640, 1250, 297, 21691, 1321, 5414, 13900, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29953, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 813641900, 'load_duration': 7414000, 'prompt_eval_count': 371, 'prompt_eval_duration': 325461000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 478560000}",0.2,-0.6,-0.7,-0.7,-0.7
29,"July 21 , 1971 The opinions expressed recently by Second District Federal Reserve Bank directors seemed to reflect some renewed doubts regarding the strength of the economic recovery . The directors in general foresaw no near-term improvement in the unemployment picture—indeed a few expected further weakening—and some felt that additional disruptive strikes were in the offing . On the other hand , the outlook for consumer spending and residential construction remains good ; no significant changes in the trends in these sectors were thought to have occurred in the recent past . Most of the directors felt that a widespread lack of confidence among both businessmen and consumers is a major factor in the disappointingly slow rate of economic recovery . Concerning the unemployment situation , the directors felt the continuing efforts of businessmen to cut back costs made it unlikely that a significant reduction of unemployment would be achieved in the coming months . The chairman of the board of a large New York City bank said he expected that his firm would have a smaller staff at the end of 1971 than it had earlier in the year , and felt that other financial institutions-the city 's strongest employers—also would not contribute much support for the local job market this year . The president of a nationwide manufacturer of plumbing and related products felt that the wage-cost squeeze was forcing industry to cut back on spending and employment .

The Buffalo Branch directors agreed that labor markets in their locality generally continue to experience",-0.75,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:26:10.0402758Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.75}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 29967, 11850, 29871, 29906, 29896, 1919, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29896, 450, 26971, 13384, 10325, 491, 6440, 7457, 14879, 27811, 10253, 1513, 943, 6140, 304, 9432, 777, 23011, 287, 27455, 1372, 11211, 278, 9324, 310, 278, 17407, 24205, 869, 450, 1513, 943, 297, 2498, 363, 267, 1450, 694, 2978, 29899, 8489, 20414, 297, 278, 443, 3451, 22812, 7623, 30003, 25201, 287, 263, 2846, 3806, 4340, 8062, 8333, 30003, 392, 777, 7091, 393, 5684, 766, 6685, 573, 19492, 267, 892, 297, 278, 1283, 292, 869, 1551, 278, 916, 1361, 1919, 278, 714, 6914, 363, 21691, 805, 2548, 322, 20201, 616, 7632, 9242, 1781, 2056, 694, 7282, 3620, 297, 278, 534, 1975, 297, 1438, 409, 14359, 892, 2714, 304, 505, 10761, 297, 278, 7786, 4940, 869, 7849, 310, 278, 1513, 943, 7091, 393, 263, 281, 2247, 29886, 949, 10225, 310, 16420, 4249, 1716, 5381, 1527, 322, 11233, 414, 338, 263, 4655, 7329, 297, 278, 23451, 11687, 5232, 6554, 310, 17407, 24205, 869, 23924, 824, 292, 278, 443, 3451, 22812, 6434, 1919, 278, 1513, 943, 7091, 278, 3133, 292, 14231, 310, 5381, 1527, 304, 5700, 1250, 21544, 1754, 372, 25057, 393, 263, 7282, 20376, 310, 443, 3451, 22812, 723, 367, 14363, 297, 278, 6421, 7378, 869, 450, 28942, 310, 278, 7613, 310, 263, 2919, 1570, 3088, 4412, 9124, 1497, 540, 3806, 393, 670, 9226, 723, 505, 263, 7968, 13925, 472, 278, 1095, 310, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29896, 1135, 372, 750, 8859, 297, 278, 1629, 1919, 322, 7091, 393, 916, 18161, 21561, 29899, 1552, 4272, 525, 29879, 4549, 342, 5703, 414, 30003, 15189, 723, 451, 29126, 1568, 2304, 363, 278, 1887, 4982, 9999, 445, 1629, 869, 450, 6673, 310, 263, 5233, 8157, 12012, 9945, 310, 715, 3774, 292, 322, 4475, 9316, 7091, 393, 278, 281, 482, 29899, 18253, 269, 802, 29872, 911, 471, 28172, 13661, 304, 5700, 1250, 373, 805, 2548, 322, 5703, 358, 869, 13, 13, 1576, 22274, 7003, 25889, 1513, 943, 15502, 393, 10212, 2791, 1691, 297, 1009, 1887, 537, 6892, 6773, 304, 7271, 32007, 32001, 8853, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29955, 29945, 29913], 'total_duration': 679795200, 'load_duration': 3705300, 'prompt_eval_count': 384, 'prompt_eval_duration': 334794000, 'eval_count': 11, 'eval_duration': 343236000}",-0.6,-0.6,-0.6,-0.5,-0.5
30,"April 6 , 1971 The opinions expressed by the Directors of this Bank and the Buffalo branch and other business leaders in general continued to point to an uncertain economic outlook . On balance , the assessment was : a still cautious consumer attitude ; a somewhat less optimistic residential construction picture ; little or no improvement in the unemployment situation ; and relatively uninspiring prospects for 1971 corporate profits . Sentiments were mixed with respect to the likely volume of further corporate borrowing in the bond market . In view of most of the Directors and of the retailers that were contacted , the long awaited rebound in consumer spending has not as yet materialized . Indeed , it was generally believed that no real pickup in consumer spending could be expected as long as consumer confidence continued to be adversely affected by the unemployment situation . Several of the respondents , however , felt that given the current high rates of individual savings , a change in consumer mood could well trigger a sharp increase in such outlays . With respect to residential housing construction the picture painted by the respondents was somewhat less rosy than it had been in earlier months . To be sure , the consensus was that there still remained a shortage of housing for lower and middle income families , and that mortgage money had become more readily available at lower rates .

38,"October 11 , 1972 Indicators of economic activity in the Eleventh District were mixed in August . Although the Texas Industrial Production Index eased slightly from its revised record level in July , the unemployment rate for the five District states declined , and employment continued to increase . Department store sales in the District also continued strong , and construction activity rebounded sharply . However , the rate of new car registrations declined slightly . A decrease in the production of nonmanufactured goods was primarily responsible for the slight decline in the seasonally adjusted Texas Industrial Production Index in August . The decline was centered in public utilities and crude oil mining . Nevertheless , production in both these industries was well above its level of a year ago . The Index for manufacturing industries remained essentially unchanged . Seasonally adjusted total nonagricultural employment in the five Southwestern states rose to a record level in August and helped to push the unemployment rate down slightly . Both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing employment increased , with employment in durable goods manufacturing and mining showing particularly notable gains . Government employment and employment in service industries also increased in August . Slight employment declines were reported in construction and transportation and public utilities . However , all industry groups posted year-to-year gains .

39,"February 9 , 1972 Phase II policies , and competitive market forces operating in an economy performing well below its potential , are apparently combining to moderate the pace of rising prices . A survey of purchasing agents and managers in the Tenth District indicates that they perceive ( 1 ) a somewhat slower rate of price rise for materials they purchase , ( 2 ) generally good compliance by vendors with Phase II guidelines , and ( 3 ) the existence of market forces also acting to restrain price increases . Inventory policy is quite conservative , with little buildup of stocks now anticipated , almost regardless of industry . Among District banks , consumer installment lending and agricultural loan demand remain strong , while local business loan demand has shown little change in recent weeks from its basically weak position . The view from the desks of purchasing managers in the Tenth District seems to be favorable to Phase II , with overall understanding and compliance felt to be generally good . Specific comments suggest that , as far as purchasing agents are concerned , vendors generally appear to be following the Phase II guidelines . Purchasing agents for a number of firms regularly review suppliers ' prices for compliance , some require invoices to be stamped as in accordance with Price Commission rulings , and others report that notices of price rises are accompanied with word that they have been cleared with the Price Commission .

40,"August 9 , 1972 The vigor in the economic recovery reflected nationally in the most recent GNP figures appears to be mirrored in the sales reports of a number of Tenth District manufacturing firms as well as in comments elicited from bank directors . Increased sales were reported quite generally , and although little evidence of stockpiling is evident , inventory spending is keeping pace with recent sales improvements . Some firms reported longer delivery times to their customers , and there were scattered reports of lengthening lead times for inventory purchases from their suppliers . Despite sales increases , however , few of the firms contacted have added net to their work forces , and , as a consequence , there were a number of firms which reported noticeable productivity gains . Tenth District farm income rose more sharply than for the nation as a whole in the first six months of 1972 , and income prospects for all of 1972 appear to be quite strong vis-a-vis last year . Strong loan demand continues at Tenth District banks , and , with few exceptions , District banks have experienced large increases in total deposits . A near-consensus emerged as to improved business sales among those manufacturing firms and directors queried . Comments such as `` best year on record , '' `` up substantially , '' and , `` business sales are beyond targets , '' characterized the kinds of responses received .

In the Mountain States , a strong business expansion has created credit demands for financing motels , manufacturing plants , shopping centers , and resort-type homes .

48,"wage increases for fear of bringing back Phase One-type controls . Professors Eckstein , Samuelson , and Shapiro were available for comment this month . All felt the major problem for the economy is to get Phase Three `` off the ground '' . Shapiro criticized the strange and contradictory statements about Phase Three which have been made by members of the Administration . He urges greater clarification . He cited the relatively flat yield curve as evidence that `` people with money do not have inflationary expectations '' . Due to a lot of bad luck ( weather conditions and blight ) and high income elasticity of the demand for meat , Samuelson doubts prices can be held to the stated goals . Specifically , the 5.5 percent wage standard is not possible to achieve , given the recent and likely future path of the cost of living . On the other hand , cost-push inflation is not something that the monetary authorities can or ought to do a lot about , according to Samuelson . Samuelson also felt it inadvisable to be committed to a dollar parity rate at the cost of tighter interest rates than would be justified on the grounds of domestic policy . While Shapiro would have preferred to have let the dollar float , he urged the United States to stand firm in not supporting the dollar , forcing other countries to take either goods or dollars .

Nevertheless , a recent survey shows prices of existing homes in the Chicago area to average 10 percent above a year earlier , compared to an 8 percent rise in the previous 12 months . This Bank 's survey of farmland values shows an average increase of 17 percent from a year ago as of October 1 , and a rise of 8 percent in the third quarter . These are the largest increases in the 20 years of the survey . The soybean and corn harvests are coming along very well .

Those associated with capital goods and consumer goods areas mentioned that business has been extremely good , both they and their customers are having difficulty in building inventories . Several of the directors reported that they plan to keep a tight rein on their inventory situation , however . Some of the directors were of the opinion that part of the strength in new orders was the result of numerous capital goods customers placing advance orders because they fear shortages later this year . Concern was also expressed about the effect of recent price behavior on the large number of major labor negotiations scheduled through 1973 . Some of the directors are also becoming concerned about the prospects for a reduced pace of business activity in 1974 . One director whose diversified firm has record orders in all areas of its business , mentioned specifically that he expects a drop off in business next year and is therefore avoiding an overextension of plant capacity . Economists from major firms in the area are also reporting ebullient business conditions , and they are projecting a sustained high level of operations—at or near capacity—through 1973 .

53,"November 14 , 1973 Business activity in the District remains strong , although there are some signs of slowing . Apart from the weakening in housing and consumer durables , the slowing is probably more a reflection of capacity limitations and a tight supply situation in raw materials and fuels than the result of a decline in underlying demand . Our Directors and businessmen and economists in the District are gravely concerned over the energy situation and its implications for the economy in 1974 . Output in the District 's manufacturing sector continues to rise , but signs of slowing in the upward momentum are accumulating . Our monthly survey of manufacturers shows a significant decline in the proportion of firms reporting gains in new orders and backlogs in recent months . September was the poorest month of the year , and early returns for October suggest further weakening occurred . There has also been some slowdown in the rate of inventory accumulation . Delivery time , however , continues to lengthen , compounding the problem of shortages faced by virtually every firm . ( The October report of Cleveland purchasing agents questioned how there could be a recession next year in view of the fact that very little inventory is available and deliveries are taking three to six months or more on practically everything . ) There was a surge in price increases during October , as the largest proportion of firms in the ten-year history of our survey reported paying higher prices .

One major firm just opened its order books for first quarter delivery , and they expect to be filled by December . ( As in the past , this procedure of opening and closing order books will cause a distortion in the monthly series on manufacturers ' new orders for durable goods . ) Fuel shortages are likely to curtail steel output in the months ahead , according to economists from three large steel firms . Cutback in either oil or natural gas will affect their output . In addition , one major steel firm is short on coal and coke . One economist said many of its smaller steel customers have been unable to accumulate inventories and have been forced to operate hand-to-mouth .

The majority anticipate little change in long-term rates , although some expect a moderate increase in these rates . None expect either category of rates to be lower . Almost none of the respondents anticipate that the prime lending rate will rise above 7 percent at either midyear or the year-end . In reply to questions relating to their particular banks , our directors indicated that business , consumer , and mortgage loan demand strengthened moderately during the last three months . Only agricultural loan demand remained essentially unchanged . Most respondents did not essentially change their willingness to make mortgage and agricultural loans during the last three months . A few were even more moderately willing to make consumer and business loans . Taking into account their expectations for loan demand , our directors generally rated funds either very available or moderately available at their banks . Slightly more than half are aggressively seeking large certificates of deposit ( CDs ) . While the majority were paying less than 6 percent for 30- to 89-day large CDs , most were paying between 6 and 7 percent for CDs with maturities beyond 89 days . The Directors split half and half as to whether they expect disintermediation of savings and time deposits in the coming six months .

57,"December 12 , 1973 Energy shortages are beginning to cause considerable concern , but as yet the pace of economic activity continues to be strong . Retailers in most Districts anticipate good Christmas sales , and agricultural earnings continue to climb . Capital expenditures are another source of strength , and although considerable variation is reported for business investment plans for 1974 , the prospects are that capital spending will remain high . Weaknesses are most apparent in residential housing and automobile sales . The impact of petroleum shortages varies considerably from region to region , and from industry to industry . The prospective gasoline shortages are one cause of reduced demand for regular-size domestic automobiles which has resulted in layoffs in several Districts ( Atlanta , Chicago , Kansas City and San Francisco ) . Sales of compact cars are excellent , and so , interestingly enough , are sales of luxury cars . Diesel fuel , in particular , appears to be in short supply and black markets for this fuel are reported to be developing in some areas . Other industries affected include petrochemical-based plastics , manufacturers of recreational vehicles , and plywood mills . Airlines are laying off employees in several Districts , and tourism-related manufacturers are being hurt according to reports from Minneapolis , Kansas City and San Francisco . Atlanta , in contrast , notes optimism about Florida 's tourist business .

58,"April 11 , 1973 This month 's district Red Book reports indicate that the current vigorous expansion is increasingly straining capacity . Raw material shortages , lengthening delivery times and difficulties in finding skilled labor are emerging . Inflation is again the major economic concern with recent price increases rekindling inflationary fears . All districts reported continuing gains in economic activity , with most Banks describing business conditions in terms like `` robust '' ( Atlanta ) , `` expanding at a rapid pace '' ( Cleveland and Dallas ) , and '' strong '' ( Minneapolis ) . The labor picture , however , varies sharply among districts . Dallas reports the unemployment rate dropping to 3.6 percent , while the First District is still experiencing unemployment rates above 6 percent . Philadelphia reports modest gains in employment , while Chicago , Cleveland , Dallas , Atlanta , and St. Louis have tight labor markets with significant skilled labor shortages . Growing raw material shortages and lengthening delivery times were also mentioned by most Banks .

70,"February 13 , 1974 Generalizations of the current economic situation in the Seventh District have never been so difficult since the Red Book was launched almost four years ago . The growing ramifications of the energy crisis , continued rapid price inflation in the face of cutbacks in output and employment , widespread shortages , and dissatisfaction with government at all levels have created an unprecedented atmosphere of uncertainty among consumers and businessmen . This mood has been deepened by the independent truckers ' strike which began at the end of January and is not yet fully resolved . Communities dependent on the manufacture of full-sized cars and recreational vehicles are economic disaster areas . In contrast , equipment producers generally are experiencing an unparalleled boom , with many firms unable to meet production schedules . While shortages of materials and components seem worse than ever , there are reports of firms doing precautionary advance buying ( hoarding ) of fuel and supplies of other scarce materials . Most businessmen , apparently , would favor the complete abandonment of price and wage controls .

Most smaller centers of the District , however , are reported to have plenty of gasoline . ( One reason suggested for the disparity is that Chicago area motorists are taking fewer trips out of town . ) Gas shortages have substantially reduced receipts at many restaurants and other establishments dependent on auto traffic . Insurance salesmen , and other businessmen dependent on mobility , also have been hurt . Perhaps those affected by fuel shortages can take comfort in the recent words of the District 's best know economist : `` I do n't believe the energy problem changes the economic outlook very much . '' In contrast to the gasoline and diesel fuel situations , heating oil problems seem to have faded away—even in Michigan where the problem had appeared most serious . Reductions in output of autos doubtless have released fuel for other uses . Some major District gas utilities have been telling interruptible customers to plan on switching to electricity or to other fuels .

Spot checks with three local savings and loan associations—one very small , one medium-sized , and the largest—showed that all three experienced net savings inflows during October .

'' According to this director , electric utilities are canceling atomic plants because of their high capital costs , and substituting less capital intensive coal and oil plants . The irony is that atomic plants have fixed fuel costs , while coal and oil plants have rising fuel costs—so the shift away from atomic plants is inflationary in the long run . A second director confirmed this , noting that both atomic and fossil plants have been canceled because of the high cost of financing and load demand running below expectations . A number of these facilities were slated for completion after 1980 . In addition , because of rising construction costs , there is a rush to complete those plants currently under construction .

76,"January 16 , 1974 Scarcity of pipe , rigs , and work crews continues to constrain petroleum drilling in the Southwest , according to an association of drillers , since many do not have permanent workers or established lines of supply . The association reports that the shortage of drilling rigs could be a problem for as long as three years because capacity constraints are limiting the ability of manufacturers to fill a growing backlog of orders . The seasonally adjusted index of industrial production in Texas fell in November for the first time since July 1973 . The decline was centered in mining of crude oil , petroleum refining , and production of petroleum-related chemicals . Despite intensified drilling , mining of crude oil has decreased because of the reduction of domestic reserves of crude . At the same time , shortages of crude oil have contributed to the reduction in refining activity , although in recent weeks imports have been greater than they were earlier anticipated to be . Unscheduled shutdowns for repairs and maintenance have also hampered refining . A survey of manufacturers based in Texas indicates that many firms are taking action to stockpile petroleum or petroleum-related products . While many businesses complained about more limited supplies and rising prices , there is no evidence that petroleum or related products are unobtainable .

Shortages were reported in plastics , solvents , and diesel fuel , but many manufacturers seemed just as concerned about the scarcity of nonpetroleum materials such as steel ,",-0.6,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:26:45.1062498Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.6\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 29967, 15623, 653, 29871, 29896, 29953, 1919, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29946, 2522, 5666, 537, 310, 14282, 1919, 12912, 29879, 1919, 322, 664, 907, 5652, 18172, 304, 1040, 6038, 5697, 12154, 398, 4192, 8873, 297, 278, 4275, 5933, 1919, 5034, 304, 385, 15477, 310, 4192, 453, 414, 1919, 1951, 1784, 437, 451, 505, 17667, 17162, 470, 7841, 3454, 310, 11421, 869, 450, 15477, 13676, 393, 278, 3273, 482, 310, 4192, 8873, 12912, 29879, 1033, 367, 263, 1108, 363, 408, 1472, 408, 2211, 2440, 1363, 13284, 11938, 526, 4046, 292, 278, 11509, 310, 12012, 332, 414, 304, 5445, 263, 15678, 1250, 1188, 310, 11299, 869, 450, 4259, 635, 10365, 287, 2380, 310, 18408, 5802, 297, 10319, 8379, 297, 3979, 363, 278, 937, 931, 1951, 5468, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29941, 869, 450, 4845, 457, 471, 24764, 297, 1375, 292, 310, 7618, 311, 17182, 1919, 5697, 12154, 398, 2143, 2827, 1919, 322, 5802, 310, 5697, 12154, 398, 29899, 12817, 22233, 29879, 869, 19454, 12838, 2164, 4192, 8873, 1919, 1375, 292, 310, 7618, 311, 17182, 756, 9263, 1463, 1363, 310, 278, 20376, 310, 21849, 620, 20098, 310, 7618, 311, 869, 2180, 278, 1021, 931, 1919, 3273, 1179, 310, 7618, 311, 17182, 505, 26869, 304, 278, 20376, 297, 2143, 2827, 6354, 1919, 5998, 297, 7786, 11405, 24802, 505, 1063, 7621, 1135, 896, 892, 8859, 23483, 630, 304, 367, 869, 853, 816, 14989, 12522, 3204, 29879, 363, 1634, 7121, 322, 25413, 505, 884, 16366, 546, 287, 2143, 2827, 869, 319, 18994, 310, 12012, 332, 414, 2729, 297, 10319, 14088, 393, 1784, 13734, 1516, 526, 5622, 3158, 304, 10961, 29886, 488, 5697, 12154, 398, 470, 5697, 12154, 398, 29899, 12817, 9316, 869, 5806, 1784, 5381, 267, 15313, 1312, 1048, 901, 9078, 28075, 322, 20493, 26094, 1919, 727, 338, 694, 10757, 393, 5697, 12154, 398, 470, 4475, 9316, 526, 443, 711, 2408, 519, 869, 13, 13, 21322, 1179, 892, 8967, 297, 715, 579, 1199, 1919, 899, 794, 29879, 1919, 322, 2977, 295, 26413, 1919, 541, 1784, 12012, 332, 414, 6140, 925, 408, 15041, 1048, 278, 19494, 537, 310, 1661, 10963, 12154, 398, 17279, 1316, 408, 22973, 1919, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29953, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 840287300, 'load_duration': 5330800, 'prompt_eval_count': 401, 'prompt_eval_duration': 343275000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 489361000}",-0.6,-0.6,-0.6,-0.5,-0.5
77,"September 5 , 1974 An informal poll of director opinion reveals a considerable deterioration in expectations tied mainly to the slump in stock market prices . Concern over bank liquidity and credit quality is evident , but primary worries are on the status of the economy . Most directors believe the nation will be facing very difficult business conditions for at least the remainder of 1974 . However , most also believe we have no choice but to stay with a heavily restrictive monetary policy to dampen inflation . They believe that possible increased restraint in fiscal policy might permit some modest easing of credit restraint . Increased output of petrochemicals accounts for much of the continued growth in industrial production in the Eleventh District . Petroleum refining has grown steadily since March when foreign oil began flowing to Texas refineries . Crude runs to stills have now climbed well above the levels that prevailed prior to the Arab oil embargo , and expanded refinery output has increased feedstocks to chemical producers who are hard pressed to meet soaring demand . Industrial production has also been boosted by gains in textile output . Shortages of fibers have eased and have allowed textile producers to replace badly depleted inventories of finished goods . Paper producers , on the other hand , report the availability of wood pulp remains tight , but they have been able to increase output nonetheless .

The boom in drilling continues , although constrained by availability of equipment and trained manpower .

78,", but the decline in red meat prices has been 3 percent or less . This reluctance to pass lower meat animal prices on to the consumer has slowed the movement of meat through the marketing chain and has contributed to an oversupply of heavy animals . Consequently , the livestock industry continues in a depressed financial state . However , on the basis of a recent telephone survey to a limited number of commercial bankers , most cattle loans have been adequately secured during the past year , thereby minimizing the number of bad loans . It was reported that a few rural banks may be in jeopardy because of poor cattle paper . The District 's wheat situation has not improved since the last Red Book . Various reports indicate that drought has destroyed much of the crop in New Mexico and Colorado . Given the recent planting difficulties in the spring wheat regions , 1974 wheat production may fall short of official estimates . However , the crop is still expected to surpass last year 's record of 1.7 billion bushels . The volume of business loans declined substantially during May at weekly reporting banks , thereby providing some indication that business loan demand has perhaps begun to slow .

80,". Conditions in the manufacturing sector are spotty , reflecting the sluggishness in the housing and consumer sectors on the one hand and the relative strength of capital spending on the other . Industries closely related to housing and consumer durables ( lumber , glass , textiles , furniture , and appliances ) are noticeably weaker . In addition , several Districts ( New York , Chicago , Kansas City , and San Francisco ) report that some industrial materials , particularly fuels , certain chemicals , and paper , are more readily available . The easing of supply constraints in these industries is contributing to less aggressive purchasing and some declines in order backlogs . Cleveland , Chicago , Kansas City , and Dallas indicate somewhat softer prices for chemicals , fuels , and other materials , but no major break in industrial prices has occurred to date . Steel markets remain tight in most Districts , due in part to the prospective coal strike . Both Cleveland and San Francisco suggest an easing in the steel situation in coming months , however , due to the increased availability of foreign steel . The agricultural outlook appears generally weaker . Atlanta reports favorable harvest yields with the exception of the hurricane-damaged Louisiana sugar cane crop . But Chicago , St. Louis , Minneapolis , and Kansas City indicate that early frosts will substantially reduce corn and soybean yields , reducing farm incomes and increasing feed costs .

Manufacturing is generally at capacity levels , but shortages continue to hamper output . Consumer spending is described as steady to cautious . Residential housing activity is very weak , and this weakness is contributing to a slowdown in the lumber industry . The agricultural outlook is good .

Some difficulty is reported in obtaining delivery of previously ordered merchandise , particularly for the most popular new styles in soft goods and for nationally advertised toys . Most retailers regard these shortages as a usual seasonal characteristic , although the decision of some apparel manufacturers to operate on a strict `` cut-to-order '' basis is mentioned as a source of longer lead times . A related factor is the increasing number of yarn varieties , which creates a difficult inventory problem for textile raw materials manufacturers in view of more volatile shifts in demand for particular finished goods styles . Retail inventory levels are well-balanced on the whole , although some remaining excess is reported in expensive furniture lines and to a lesser degree in appliances and other big-ticket items . Retailers expect continued gains in 1976 , although some concern is noted regarding the depth of the post-holiday season downturn in consumer durable goods .

In Florida and Southern Georgia and Alabama , more than 8,000 lumber mill workers have lost their jobs in the prolonged home construction slump , which has hit the South harder than any other region . Lumber production has been cut 30 percent , and 50 mills have closed . Several District apparel manufacturers recently have closed their doors . Alabama bankers report a continuing rise in loan delinquencies , and new loan applications are being screened more closely . Contractors and suppliers note that payments are slow . An upward movement in delinquencies on installment credit was reported in the Nashville , Tennessee , area . In the past five months , bankruptcy filings have increased sharply in eastern Tennessee . An Atlanta-based credit counseling agency has seen an increase in requests for its services since last May . At first , new clients came mainly from households affected by the inflationary squeeze on their budgets .

He fears that though things look rather hopeful on first blush , the economy has no holding power—the financial condition of business especially is unfavorable and we risk stagnation if the rebound is not nurtured . He sees nonmonetary forces fueling a 6 percent inflation rate should 4 percent growth be attained ; 7.5 percent money growth would risk another slump . We need not lock the throttle at higher rates of money expansion ; we need to assist the recovery .

He notes that a 5 percent funds rate accompanies 8.3 percent money growth in his model—this is close enough to 7.5 percent to be well within our margins of forecasting and control errors . Five percent money growth would produce a depression and would be plausible only if inflation falls to the 1 to 2 percent level . Samuelson senses that the trough is near .

Today , foreign mills , particularly Japanese producers , are undercutting domestic steel prices by 20 to 25 percent . The sluggish pace of construction activity has led to extremely aggressive bidding by manufacturers of building materials for new projects . A Fort Worth manufacturer of reinforcing steel bars said mills are engaged in the most aggressive price-cutting that he has seen in 25 years in the industry . Many jobs are actually being bid below cost as mills try to keep their share of the market and attempt to hold on to the backbone of their work force . A survey of independent oil producers reveals a consensus of opinion that the proposed energy legislation before Congress would be a disaster if enacted . The respondents feel changes are due but not in the direction of those proposed . Not only would changes now being considered roll back crude oil prices from an average of $ 8.75 per barrel to $ 7.66 , but legislation would tighten the rules expensing intangible drilling costs . The latter change would reduce funds available for drilling and impact most severely on small independents , who account for much exploratory drilling . Passage of the legislation would not affect current drilling commitments , but thereafter , new commitments could fall off sharply . New car sales have firmed at District dealerships .

99,"payback from a REIT bankruptcy has reached 25 percent and is expected to go higher , reducing that loss to less than the amount the bank had already charged off . Bankers report a favorable outlook for expansion in consumer credit during the coming holiday season in light of growing indications that consumers are stepping up their spending . One positive sign has been a sharp decrease in the number of applications for debt consolidation loans this year . Credit card usage is on the rise , and suburban bankers note that automobile loans have picked up . In addition , there are numerous reports of banks offering comprehensive service packages in attempts to rekindle consumer borrowing . Good harvests , increased marketings of cattle , and higher average prices since midyear have bolstered crop and livestock sales in the Eleventh District . Consequently , cash flows to farmers and ranches have improved , and rural bankers report the rate of loan repayment has increased while the number of renewals and extensions has declined . Although flush with funds , agribankers continue to be very cautious in granting credit . Uncertainty over markets and weather and the carryover effects of depressed incomes in 1974 , particularly among cattle feeders , serve to keep collateral requirements firm . Nevertheless , agricultural lending this fall is above year-earlier levels . Rising production costs and slightly more acreage in cultivation have increased the farmer 's demand for bank credit .

The District 's rural areas continue to be relatively unaffected by the recession . Unemployment continues to rise .

Recent figures , though improved from the beginning of this year , were well below the numbers issued in the early 1970s . Also , district nonresidential building spending remained down from a year ago . Savings deposit growth at district commercial banks and savings and loan associations slowed somewhat in the third quarter , following rapid growth during the first half of 1975 . The slowdown largely reflected the growing attractiveness of U.S. Government Securities , whose yields have risen above the highest rates that savings institutions are permitted to pay . Mortgage loans closed and mortgage loan commitments by district S & Ls continued to climb rapidly in the third quarter . However , if past relationships prevail , S & Ls will soon be scaling back the volume of new loan commitments to match the slower savings growth . Loan growth at district commercial banks strengthened substantially in September from the weak pattern that had existed during 1975 .",-0.4,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:27:05.3771355Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": -0.4\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 29874, 1629, 8020, 869, 450, 1473, 29899, 339, 4254, 5839, 786, 297, 3271, 25237, 471, 451, 15075, 7114, 297, 278, 4654, 12616, 869, 379, 681, 292, 5190, 4148, 17063, 297, 5468, 29899, 26197, 871, 19228, 1473, 29899, 339, 4254, 11174, 869, 3599, 296, 13994, 1919, 2466, 16710, 515, 278, 6763, 310, 445, 1629, 1919, 892, 1532, 2400, 278, 3694, 16610, 297, 278, 4688, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29900, 29879, 869, 3115, 1919, 6474, 1661, 690, 1693, 616, 5214, 805, 2548, 9488, 1623, 515, 263, 1629, 8020, 869, 9583, 886, 19754, 277, 14321, 472, 6474, 12128, 24388, 322, 4048, 886, 322, 24806, 27733, 5232, 287, 10579, 297, 278, 4654, 12616, 1919, 1494, 10952, 14321, 2645, 278, 937, 4203, 310, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29945, 869, 450, 5232, 3204, 18425, 25312, 278, 15678, 13978, 20193, 310, 501, 29889, 29903, 29889, 10354, 5356, 332, 1907, 1919, 5069, 17498, 505, 5161, 264, 2038, 278, 9939, 19257, 393, 4048, 886, 21561, 526, 21905, 304, 5146, 869, 15533, 29887, 482, 658, 550, 5764, 322, 5758, 29887, 482, 24806, 9063, 1860, 491, 6474, 317, 669, 365, 29879, 7572, 304, 10784, 29890, 19328, 297, 278, 4654, 12616, 869, 2398, 1919, 565, 4940, 21702, 12379, 737, 1919, 317, 669, 365, 29879, 674, 4720, 367, 21640, 1250, 278, 7977, 310, 716, 24806, 9063, 1860, 304, 1993, 278, 20312, 4048, 886, 14321, 869, 4309, 273, 14321, 472, 6474, 12128, 24388, 9324, 6419, 23228, 368, 297, 3839, 515, 278, 8062, 4766, 393, 750, 22856, 2645, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29945, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29908, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29946, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 712542800, 'load_duration': 4059400, 'prompt_eval_count': 300, 'prompt_eval_duration': 258040000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 445350000}",0.3,-0.6,-0.3,-0.2,-0.6
104,"January 15 , 1975 District `` Red Book '' reports for mid-January generally reflect the accentuation in most parts of the country of the pronounced deterioration of the economy in the recent past suggested by nationwide economic indicators . Retail sales in most areas over the holiday season were only equal or barely above last year 's level in dollar terms and , given the sharp rise in retail prices over the past year , lower in volume . Moreover , this year 's level was achieved only by dint of heavy pre-Christmas aggressive promotion , special sales , and price cutting in addition to the usual early January clearance sales . Against this background , a number of respondents in various Districts regarded retail inventories to be relatively high to excessive in relation to current sale prospects , with increased reports of efforts to reduce positions , both at the retail and manufacturing level . Planned business plant and equipment outlays , apart from energy related industries , on balance appeared to be weaker than had been expected , and a number of Districts report cutbacks , or outright cancellations of planned projects . The private residential construction , and to a lesser extent commercial construction , picture remained bleak , although a reported moderate reversal in the outflow of deposits at thrift institutions gives hope that the eventual bottoming of the decline in that industry may be approaching .

Concern is voiced by some branch directors that disclosures of `` problem '' loans in testimony before congressional committees may precipitate financial pressures sufficient to force business firms into bankruptcy , thereby jeopardizing the employment of many workers . A brighter note about construction activity concerns three new hotels oriented toward convention business which have recently been completed in Atlanta . A total of 2,850 rooms have been added to the city 's hotel accommodations , all of which are near the downtown area . The negative aspect of reduced construction employment is offset by increased services employment produced by the opening of the three hotels . Additional developments in Southeastern labor markets include the end of the 126-day strike of flight attendants against National Air Lines during early January . One community served by the carrier is reportedly seeking to obtain more reliable service by having its route transferred to another carrier . Also , 1,800 workers who were laid off two years ago , were recalled by the General Motors plant in Atlanta as a result of improvements in new car sales ; an additional 500 new jobs have been created .

Banking directors report that businessmen , on balance , are attempting to reduce their reliance on bank loans . Firms are still issuing medium and long-term debt to improve the structure of their balance sheets . Bankers are particularly disappointed by the lack of demand for inventory financing . However , competition for loan customers has not led to discounts on the effective interest rate for loans . In fact , bankers are concerned about yields on business loans dropping too low : work-outs have reduced earnings , while write-offs have been and continue to be heavy . The pace of retail sales is not uniform throughout the district .

Appliance sales are far below expectations . Agricultural harvests are ahead of normal schedules . Lenders of all types have ample funds . Many firms experienced losses as a result of the devaluation of the Mexican peso . Although forecasts of the rate of expansion are more subdued and cautious , there seems to be no expectation that a recession is imminent . In fact , more analysts now anticipate that the upswing will continue into 1978 . The recent slowdown suggests to them that satisfaction of various demands is being pushed into the future . Sales of heavy trucks and trailers are well above last year and further gains are expected for 1977 , but the size of the expected increase in sales has been reduced . Orders for large outdoor cranes and some other types of construction equipment have picked up recently from depressed levels . Orders for mining equipment are sharply lower than last year , but inquiries have been at a high rate .

116,"until nonresidential construction begins a comeback . But even stronger demand for construction materials may not help the steel industry because as much as three-fourths of the current production of some firms goes into oil field equipment manufacturing which is now beginning to soften . In addition , aluminum output continues at the low level established last summer . Domestic drilling activity has taken a turn for the worse . After reaching a 14-year high in late December , the total number of active rotary drilling rigs dropped 16 percent to a 17-month low in March . A seasonal decline in drilling is expected in the first quarter of each year ; but according to some industry spokesmen , the cutback was also in response to a rollback in the average price of domestic crude oil to $ 7.66 a barrel—down from the January high of $ 8.43 . Many drilling contractors expect the decline to slow and drilling to begin a seasonal upswing in the last half of the year . However , the future is clouded by proposed legislation that is unfavorable to the industry .

117,"quarter of 1975 . For the month ended January 15 , prices received by farmers dropped 0.5 percent following a modest increase in December . Given the evidence of increased cattle placements in feedlots during the fourth quarter , together with the beginning of an expansion in hog farrowings , meat supplies in 1976 promise to be large enough to offer some stability to retail prices—assuming that the farm-to-retail margins do not widen significantly . The winter wheat situation in the District is still hanging in the balance due to the lack of moisture . Several stories of farmers abandoning the crop , taking steps to prevent wind erosion where there is no wheat , and applying for disaster payments have been reported in the news media . However , a large crop is still possible if the weather cooperates over the next few months . And , if crop producers follow through with their intentions as reported in January , the production of most crops in 1976 will likely be large enough to restrain any sharp rise in prices . In fact , given the information on probable carry-over stocks next summer and fall , grain prices could slide rather significantly should 1976 production levels be of bumper proportions . Tenth District bankers contacted had mixed views of business loan strength . Four banks indicated January declines in business loans while three reported strong gains .

Shifting of national accounts was mentioned by several banks as a major reason for either increased or decreased loan",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:27:16.6113456Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 339, 4254, 310, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29945, 869, 1152, 278, 4098, 9698, 5490, 29871, 29896, 29945, 1919, 26094, 4520, 491, 2215, 13269, 13700, 29871, 29900, 29889, 29945, 10151, 1494, 263, 878, 342, 7910, 297, 5846, 869, 11221, 278, 10757, 310, 11664, 27498, 2174, 29883, 4110, 297, 8343, 29880, 1862, 2645, 278, 11582, 12616, 1919, 4208, 411, 278, 6763, 310, 385, 13184, 297, 298, 468, 2215, 798, 886, 1919, 27654, 28075, 297, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29953, 11640, 304, 367, 2919, 3307, 304, 5957, 777, 25806, 304, 3240, 737, 26094, 30003, 465, 9929, 393, 278, 17888, 29899, 517, 29899, 2267, 737, 15276, 1144, 437, 451, 281, 3615, 16951, 869, 450, 13851, 21266, 271, 6434, 297, 278, 7457, 338, 1603, 298, 9776, 297, 278, 17346, 2861, 304, 278, 10225, 310, 2730, 391, 545, 869, 21882, 15874, 310, 2215, 13269, 11807, 292, 278, 274, 1336, 1919, 5622, 6576, 304, 5557, 8805, 604, 359, 291, 988, 727, 338, 694, 21266, 271, 1919, 322, 15399, 363, 766, 1901, 5146, 1860, 505, 1063, 8967, 297, 278, 9763, 5745, 869, 2398, 1919, 263, 2919, 274, 1336, 338, 1603, 1950, 565, 278, 14826, 1302, 3372, 1078, 975, 278, 2446, 2846, 7378, 869, 1126, 1919, 565, 274, 1336, 1391, 22543, 1101, 1549, 411, 1009, 7609, 1080, 408, 8967, 297, 5490, 1919, 278, 5802, 310, 1556, 8182, 567, 297, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29953, 674, 5517, 367, 2919, 3307, 304, 1791, 6038, 738, 15301, 14451, 297, 26094, 869, 512, 2114, 1919, 2183, 278, 2472, 373, 16269, 8677, 29899, 957, 10961, 29879, 2446, 11801, 322, 6416, 1919, 2646, 262, 26094, 1033, 20343, 3265, 16951, 881, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29953, 5802, 11174, 367, 310, 289, 398, 546, 12098, 1080, 869, 323, 9097, 7457, 9124, 414, 6958, 287, 750, 12849, 8386, 310, 5381, 24806, 9324, 869, 12458, 24388, 18694, 5490, 4845, 1475, 297, 5381, 658, 550, 1550, 2211, 8967, 4549, 330, 2708, 869, 13, 13, 2713, 24377, 310, 4797, 15303, 471, 5276, 491, 3196, 24388, 408, 263, 4655, 2769, 363, 2845, 11664, 470, 9263, 1463, 24806, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 933290600, 'load_duration': 5405000, 'prompt_eval_count': 386, 'prompt_eval_duration': 345123000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 579141000}",0.4,0.2,-0.2,0.25,0.2

Buyers showed renewed interest in both intermediate and full-sized models . Inventories of automobiles on dealer lots were being kept at normal or low levels . There was little evidence of recovery in the District 's manufacturing sector . Manufacturing employment bottomed out in June 1975 and has been virtually flat since then . Nonetheless , survey results indicate that manufacturing sales expectations are improving . The overall employment picture was somewhat brighter than in the manufacturing sector . Since June , employment has been increasing steadily . Nonetheless , the year-end unemployment rate remained high due to labor force fluctuations . The construction sector was giving little impetus to the economic recovery .

120,"their responses in April , when only 31 percent reported low spending and 25 percent expected more low spending for the next quarter . Most directors reported quite strong residential construction activity but mostly in just the single-family market . A director whose firm is a major producer of temperature controls cited information indicating that single-family construction was much stronger in the Ninth District than in the nation . He expected that strength to increase in the third quarter . With regard to apartment building , he mentioned a national association of home builders survey , which found a rather sharp second-quarter recovery in multifamily construction that was expected to gain momentum during the remainder of 1976 and into 1977 . Also , a recent Twin Cities metropolitan area apartment survey reported that vacancy rates had declined to quite a low level , a usual sign that a pickup is due . However , many observers felt that rental rates were not high enough to justify new apartment construction in the District . Reports from directors on building activity in their respective areas showed nonresidential construction weaker than residential construction . However , the director whose firm manufactures temperature controls believed nonresidential construction had begun to recover and should be very strong by 1977 , up 10 to 15 percent in constant terms . Directors agreed that economic policies would be a major part in this year 's Presidential campaign .

One director thought that policies regarding inflation would be important to either side because of",-0.2,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:27:18.9552553Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": -0.2\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 1552, 381, 20890, 297, 3786, 1919, 746, 871, 29871, 29941, 29896, 10151, 8967, 4482, 805, 2548, 322, 29871, 29906, 29945, 10151, 3806, 901, 4482, 805, 2548, 363, 278, 2446, 12616, 869, 7849, 1513, 943, 8967, 3755, 4549, 20201, 616, 7632, 6354, 541, 11149, 297, 925, 278, 2323, 29899, 11922, 9999, 869, 319, 8881, 5069, 9226, 338, 263, 4655, 14297, 310, 10430, 11761, 274, 1573, 2472, 23941, 393, 2323, 29899, 11922, 7632, 471, 1568, 23505, 297, 278, 405, 22653, 7457, 1135, 297, 278, 5233, 869, 940, 3806, 393, 9324, 304, 7910, 297, 278, 4654, 12616, 869, 2973, 4880, 304, 263, 8076, 5214, 1919, 540, 5276, 263, 4797, 15477, 310, 3271, 2048, 414, 18994, 1919, 607, 1476, 263, 3265, 15301, 1473, 29899, 339, 4254, 24205, 297, 1773, 361, 1344, 29891, 7632, 393, 471, 3806, 304, 11581, 19399, 2645, 278, 21162, 310, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29953, 322, 964, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29955, 869, 3115, 1919, 263, 7786, 323, 5080, 315, 1907, 25311, 8929, 4038, 263, 8076, 18994, 8967, 393, 11757, 6906, 19257, 750, 4845, 1312, 304, 3755, 263, 4482, 3233, 1919, 263, 9670, 1804, 393, 263, 5839, 786, 338, 2861, 869, 2398, 1919, 1784, 5366, 874, 7091, 393, 364, 13703, 19257, 892, 451, 1880, 3307, 304, 26922, 716, 263, 8076, 7632, 297, 278, 7457, 869, 830, 4011, 515, 1513, 943, 373, 5214, 6354, 297, 1009, 18067, 10161, 10018, 1661, 690, 1693, 616, 7632, 591, 5790, 1135, 20201, 616, 7632, 869, 2398, 1919, 278, 8881, 5069, 9226, 12012, 1973, 10430, 11761, 13112, 1661, 690, 1693, 616, 7632, 750, 23580, 304, 9792, 322, 881, 367, 1407, 4549, 491, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29955, 1919, 701, 29871, 29896, 29900, 304, 29871, 29896, 29945, 10151, 297, 4868, 4958, 869, 8797, 943, 15502, 393, 17407, 24833, 723, 367, 263, 4655, 760, 297, 445, 1629, 525, 29879, 7178, 616, 11531, 869, 13, 13, 6716, 8881, 2714, 393, 24833, 11211, 4414, 362, 723, 367, 4100, 304, 2845, 2625, 1363, 310, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29908, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29906, 13, 29913], 'total_duration': 772574700, 'load_duration': 513000, 'prompt_eval_count': 373, 'prompt_eval_duration': 348986000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 415270000}",0.4,0.4,0.6,0.6,0.6
121,"February 11 , 1976 Strong retail sales are the key to a generally optimistic outlook for the Redbook this month . Nearly every District focuses attention on the strength of consumer demand as an indication that the economy may be regaining some of the momentum it lost in the latter months of 1975 . The picture is still far from rosy , but the outlook is distinctly more optimistic . Even though capital goods industries are still weak , the rest of the manufacturing sector is gaining strength . Inventories have been brought into line with sales and new orders are up . Two persistent weak spots—the construction industry 's slump and high urban unemployment—remain gloomy , but inflationary pressures seem to be moderating in several Districts . While there is little disagreement that `` catch-up '' efforts in wage negotiations scheduled for 1976 pose a problem for stabilizing production costs , there are differences of opinion on the likelihood that food prices will rise significantly during the next few months . The financial sector continues to build liquidity rather than expand . Savings are flowing into commercial banks and thrift institutions at very rapid rates .

Business loan demand is certainly not at desired levels , however , and investment in bankers ' acceptances continues . Both consumer installment and real estate loans show continued strength . The District 's farm income situation improved during August , largely because marketing of the flue-cured crop was well underway and prices were up sharply from last year .

The level of shipments , in fact , has remained essentially unchanged since June , while the volume of new orders has registered minimal declines in each of the past 3 months . Backlogs of orders and finished goods inventories are down somewhat from July , and stocks of materials are reported to have risen slightly since then . Manufacturing inventories remain somewhat above desired levels as does current plant and equipment capacity . Retailers apparently experienced some improvement in sales during August , but at least one respondent attributes this to heavy price markdowns . Sales of big-ticket items continue to lag relative to total sales . Demand for bank loans remains soft . In the agricultural sector , dry weather for the past several weeks has damaged pastures and most major crops in wide areas of the District . Survey responses of District manufacturers exhibit much the same pattern as in the past 2 months , suggesting a stable level of shipments , some weakness in the volume of new orders , and a small decline in order backlogs . Some accumulation of materials inventories in August is indicated , but over one-third of the respondents report reduced stocks of finished goods . Thirty-seven percent of the manufacturers still feel current inventory levels are higher than desired .

'' New orders for commercial aircraft continue soft , and employment is declining , but revenue passenger miles flown are showing signs of recovery , which should have a favorable impact on orders in the near future . Although new housing construction continues depressed , there has been a noticeable enlivening of building permit activity in many geographic areas of the Twelfth District . The permit activity generally recognizes that the apartments and condominium market continues in an overbuilt condition , but demand for single-family homes has turned the corner . There has also been a scattered but increasing number of inquiries at banks about industrial real estate loans `` with no particular concentration on any industry '' .

Steel shipments are expected to rise 11 percent in 1977 to about 100 million tons . Inventories of steel users and steel service centers have been reduced to desired levels . The precise level of steel shipments in 1977 will depend on the volume of imports , mainly from Japan , which is expected to increase . Most analysts now expect sales of both cars and trucks to increase in l977—to a new record in the case of trucks . Sales of recreational vehicles are also expected to show another large rise . The sharp contrast between very poor sales of small cars and strong sales of intermediate and standard size types continues . The smallest auto company , which produces small cars almost exclusively , admits to a very precarious financial position . It is feared that this company 's Milwaukee plant will be closed down for good . This company hopes to escape the full impact of the labor settlement agreed to by the large auto and farm equipment producers , valued at 13 percent for the first year . Demand for farm equipment has fallen off , and a decline in sales is expected for 1977 . Bankers note a buildup of farm equipment inventories in the hands of dealers , including the heaviest tractors , which had been on allocation until recently .

The effect appears to be more through holding down imports , rather than through increasing exports .

They insist that incentives to develop new supplies are inadequate and that proposed measures to reduce consumption would be inefficient and vary costly to implement .

Sales of most types of farm equipment are running below last year . Heavy trucks , trailers , light construction equipment , and various components are relatively strong . Sales of energy-related equipment are good , but not up to expectations . Orders for machine tools , especially those for auto companies , are well above last year and further gains are expected in 1978 .

A director of a department store chain cautions that slower gains in income and an unsustainably high proportion of expenditures for automotive and luxury-type goods would likely hold down future consumer spending . An economist in retail trade expects slower growth in disposable income and increased personal saving rates will hold overall gains in real consumer expenditures to about a 3 % annual rate of increase this half . He does not believe that the rapid rate of increase in retail sales last month can be sustained , nor is it consistent with forecasts of only 4-to-5 % quarterly gains",-0.6,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:27:34.7219289Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": -0.6\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 9632, 1833, 1629, 869, 3118, 7766, 391, 21875, 393, 22973, 11817, 3842, 5279, 526, 871, 10029, 2038, 1906, 2645, 534, 820, 29879, 297, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29900, 29899, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29896, 322, 5683, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29953, 1919, 297, 21100, 310, 278, 2114, 393, 27430, 338, 2050, 2197, 6133, 1135, 297, 1906, 23704, 869, 3189, 2496, 322, 885, 2390, 11817, 3842, 4934, 491, 697, 9226, 526, 8967, 304, 367, 472, 385, 599, 29899, 2230, 1880, 322, 674, 5517, 367, 5700, 869, 11263, 311, 17182, 322, 10489, 26496, 10961, 29879, 6773, 472, 11174, 1532, 2038, 263, 1629, 8020, 1919, 5998, 697, 2143, 262, 708, 8967, 263, 3265, 269, 13902, 20376, 297, 10489, 26496, 10961, 29879, 2645, 3111, 869, 1551, 278, 916, 1361, 1919, 1320, 453, 403, 322, 10995, 950, 26413, 10961, 29879, 526, 871, 10029, 2038, 1833, 1629, 525, 29879, 11174, 322, 408, 269, 1662, 1391, 22543, 674, 13229, 12242, 304, 7910, 1906, 10961, 29879, 869, 8797, 943, 322, 24921, 6942, 411, 21691, 22535, 526, 12849, 297, 1009, 8386, 1048, 27289, 29879, 363, 21691, 805, 2548, 869, 7753, 2466, 16538, 330, 2708, 297, 3111, 892, 2919, 6198, 304, 263, 1629, 8859, 1919, 777, 3240, 737, 414, 3933, 274, 1300, 2738, 869, 319, 8881, 310, 263, 14311, 3787, 9704, 5777, 17925, 393, 20312, 330, 2708, 297, 17869, 322, 385, 9644, 504, 475, 2197, 1880, 18618, 310, 1518, 355, 277, 1973, 363, 3345, 327, 573, 322, 21684, 2857, 29899, 1853, 22535, 723, 5517, 4808, 1623, 5434, 21691, 805, 2548, 869, 530, 7766, 391, 297, 3240, 737, 11302, 23347, 20312, 14321, 297, 11549, 519, 17869, 322, 11664, 7333, 14238, 19257, 674, 4808, 12463, 330, 2708, 297, 1855, 21691, 1518, 355, 277, 1973, 304, 1048, 263, 29871, 29941, 1273, 17568, 6554, 310, 7910, 445, 4203, 869, 940, 947, 451, 4658, 393, 278, 10952, 6554, 310, 7910, 297, 3240, 737, 16538, 1833, 4098, 508, 367, 15075, 7114, 1919, 3643, 338, 372, 13747, 411, 29821, 19416, 310, 871, 29871, 29946, 29899, 517, 29899, 29945, 1273, 12616, 368, 330, 2708, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29908, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29953, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 801381200, 'load_duration': 5943200, 'prompt_eval_count': 386, 'prompt_eval_duration': 356367000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 436030000}",0.35,-0.6,-0.2,-0.2,-0.2

Directors , financial officers , and economists contacted generally expressed confidence that the economy will continue to expand for the next several quarters but at a moderated pace from the first half of 1977 .

142,"June 15 , 1977 Economic activity in the Fourth District continues to expand moderately , except for recent flattening in retail sales . Retailers have experienced some slowing in sales , including new cars , although producers are still optimistic about prospects . Capital goods producers expect spending in 1977 will rise at least in line with the latest Department of Commerce survey on capital spending . The recent surge in steel output , supported by a high level of auto production and inventory buildup , is expected to end shortly . Economists who met at this Bank on June 3 expect the rate of growth in real GNP to slow to an annual rate of about 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 percent from 1977-III to 1978-II . Bank and savings and loan officials see little evidence on speculation in housing , but savings and loan associations have been expanding the use of second mortgages as a source of consumer financing . Retailers indicated a mixed pattern of consumer spending over the past several weeks . Some department store officials are concerned about near-term sales prospects .

The unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in October—the lowest rate for the year . Preliminary indications suggest Christmas sales this year will be up sharply from a year ago . Residential construction remains strong , while nonresidential construction activity is making a year-end surge . But industry spokesmen predict a slowing in construction activity by mid-1978 . The demand for home mortgages remains very active , but savings and loan associations suggest market demands will slow in coming months . Most petroleum refiners continue to put aside plans for plant and equipment spending until a national energy policy is established . Because profit margins have improved , the number of cattle on feed in Texas is up sharply from the level a year ago . Department store executives indicate Christmas sales should be excellent this year . Thanksgiving sales were l4 percent above a year ago , end December sales may well top that rate of increase . Although consumers continue to be price and quality conscious and are making practical gift selections , many show a ready willingness to buy expensive gifts . The more popular selling items include major appliances and electronic television games .

According to one director from an agricultural area , the quality of the wheat stand is excellent and the crop prospects for the coming year are `` very good when compared with this time last year . '' If the new crop continues to receive rain , wheat pasture will be available for grazing and some ranchers will probably take advantage of this cheap source of feed . Thus , prices for light cattle may strengthen as a result of this activity . Because most farmers were uncertain about the details of the new farm program when they started planting their wheat , acreage in the District 's major producing states is expected to be about equal to 1977 levels . However , as farmers become more familiar with the program , some of the crop will probably be destroyed so that their eligibility for full Government benefits will not be jeopardized . This strategy may be employed because , with the huge stocks of wheat now on hand , the price outlook for the coming year is not bright for producers . Most Tenth District bankers contacted report strong loan demand , especially in energy-related businesses and in real estate loans , both residential and commercial .

'' Directors also report strong retail sales outside Minneapolis/St . Paul , except in areas affected by the iron ore workers ' strike and in smaller communities where farm income is down considerably . District manufacturing sales are strong too ; overall they are stronger than expected . During the first nine months of this year , manufacturing sales were up about 14 percent from a year ago , but in August manufacturers expected only a 10 percent increase in the fourth quarter . In November , however , manufacturers reported a fourth-quarter sales gain about the same size as the rest of the year ( with durable goods sales up 17 percent ; nondurable goods sales , 11 percent ) .

One executive of a national retail chain indicated that all divisions had exceeded their budgets , tying up more funds in inventories than was desired . Industrial respondents also reported increases in inventories .

On the other hand , when our major creditor , Saudi Arabia , insists that something be done , token intervention may be a wise near-term political expedient . Houthakker believes intervention may occasionally be necessary when market conditions become disorderly as may have been the case in the early days of the new year . Further intervention , however , is not necessary and not in the best interests of the United States . Lower import prices would help meet Germany 's and Japan 's concern about inflation and provide them with more elbow room to pursue expansionary policies . Although declines in the dollar do contribute to our inflation , the magnitude of the impact so far is one we can live with . Unlike 1972 and 1973 , the rise in the prices of our imports have not been accompanied by sharp increases in the price of exported goods . Tobin does not object to short-run intervention to stabilize irrational day-to-day speculation but does oppose trying to peg the exchange rate . Tobin doubts that the dollar would be overvalued if Germany and Japan were operating at reasonable levels of capacity , and questions whether it is overvalued anyway . Recent declines reflect portfolio shifts by OPEC investors that have little to do with the fundamental value of the dollar .

Both respondents agree that there is a very real possibility of a `` credit crunch '' developing in the second half of this year , although neither believes that the present level of interest rates will necessarily lead to this outcome . They also agreed that while an overly ambitious attempt to slow the rate of money growth could easily produce a recession , the economy 's prospects in the absence of this policy are for slower but still acceptable real growth in the months immediately ahead .",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:27:50.293989Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 20678, 278, 937, 4723, 310, 5468, 869, 450, 6282, 391, 13661, 297, 14622, 1570, 5408, 338, 2215, 292, 1407, 1532, 869, 4649, 737, 414, 526, 10579, 623, 9003, 6270, 1048, 278, 5434, 3236, 310, 278, 26504, 322, 777, 4459, 393, 11817, 3842, 1122, 367, 263, 2586, 1880, 2056, 541, 445, 5932, 338, 451, 2729, 373, 3935, 7271, 869, 9134, 263, 4655, 14311, 3787, 9704, 322, 263, 2919, 19725, 3461, 393, 443, 15914, 1821, 289, 6090, 322, 4319, 2553, 1372, 1919, 607, 7910, 408, 278, 26504, 8062, 575, 1919, 526, 4482, 322, 20327, 869, 450, 5120, 525, 29879, 7766, 2879, 526, 1919, 363, 278, 1556, 760, 1919, 2050, 2197, 901, 282, 404, 326, 4695, 1048, 278, 17407, 714, 6914, 1135, 526, 1556, 5381, 1527, 869, 2180, 263, 7786, 11705, 292, 310, 5381, 7766, 2879, 14183, 714, 310, 17680, 9859, 263, 6976, 297, 19163, 310, 29871, 29945, 29900, 10151, 304, 278, 27289, 310, 263, 337, 985, 291, 297, 5683, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29947, 470, 4688, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29929, 869, 2138, 4680, 2553, 29873, 1919, 278, 6554, 310, 4414, 362, 322, 278, 14879, 27811, 525, 29879, 2933, 892, 278, 8405, 363, 1009, 15482, 16103, 29821, 19416, 869, 6175, 404, 943, 382, 384, 5465, 322, 15316, 1100, 892, 3625, 363, 3440, 445, 4098, 869, 9134, 10049, 1237, 8661, 393, 727, 338, 263, 1407, 1855, 13331, 310, 263, 4954, 16200, 2181, 3322, 6629, 14338, 297, 278, 1473, 4203, 310, 445, 1629, 1919, 5998, 9561, 1339, 17180, 393, 278, 2198, 3233, 310, 4066, 19257, 674, 12695, 3275, 304, 445, 21957, 869, 2688, 884, 15502, 393, 1550, 385, 975, 368, 626, 2966, 2738, 4218, 304, 5232, 278, 6554, 310, 6909, 14321, 1033, 5948, 7738, 263, 337, 985, 291, 1919, 278, 26504, 525, 29879, 27289, 29879, 297, 278, 18070, 310, 445, 8898, 526, 363, 20312, 541, 1603, 22691, 1855, 14321, 297, 278, 7378, 7389, 14432, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 826269700, 'load_duration': 6432100, 'prompt_eval_count': 362, 'prompt_eval_duration': 326505000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 490515000}",0.35,0.6,-0.3,0.2,0.5
161,"March 15 , 1978 Business activity in the Seventh District was depressed by severe weather conditions in both January and February . The coal strike began to register an adverse impact on output in late February , but this influence is still relatively minor , and largely confined to Indiana . Some retailers are very pleased with recent sales , but others are not . There is evidence that consumers are holding back on purchases of autos and other big ticket items . Business capital outlays are expected to rise this year , both for equipment and structures . Demand for farm equipment is conspicuously weak . The long severe winter has hampered construction activity to an abnormal degree . Demand for credit appears to be strengthening , especially for bank loans to larger businesses . Interest rates are expected to move at least moderately higher as demand for credit increases while savings inflows to Thrift institutions remain slow . Knowledgeable business managers in the district believe that the coal strike negotiations have been `` bungled . '' The pact presented to the miners for ratification took away some benefits won earlier , and attempted to place unacceptable penalties on wildcat strikes . ( These views come from management observers . ) Nevertheless , a settlement is expected soon with various key sections rewritten . All affected activities are expected to rebound after the coal strike is settled . However , the experience adds to inflationary pressures .

There are few indications that inventories are excessive , and some items are in tight supply . Demand for capital goods is generally , but not universally , strong . Residential activity is holding up better than had been expected . Prospects for commercial and industrial construction are favorable . Corn and soybean crops are developing well . Informed people are deeply concerned about inflation , the foreign trade deficit , high taxes , and high interest rates , but there is no evidence of a rush to the storm cellars . In September 1974 , just before the sharp recession , there were significant signs that both consumers and businesses were holding back on spending decisions . Local polls of consumer sentiment reflect the widespread pessimism reported nationally . There is no clear evidence , however , that people are restraining their desires for goods and services . Retail sales remain vigorous , overall . The largest national retailer has been reporting very narrow volume gains from a year ago , but last year this firm was offering deep discounts to stimulate sales and profit margins were affected adversely .

171,", but these shortages were not expected to affect production . Plant managers , mechanics and mold makers were also cited as specialized skills that were in relative tight supply by one director . For the most part , retail sales in May and early June were judged to have been on target . Nevertheless , for the year as a whole , several merchants felt that sales were below expectations . As a consequence , retailers viewed their inventories as somewhat high , but voiced little concern over their ability to work off any excesses once the summer sales season rolled into gear . Automotive sales have been brisk in recent months . One industry economist attributed the current spurt to a combination of `` catch-up '' buying after the past winter and consumers attempt to beat price increases due on the new model year cars . Thus , he expected sales to taper off considerably later in the summer . Outside of the retail sector , the outlook for capital spending in the District appears to have strengthened . The president of a major utility reported that his firm was experiencing record growth that , in turn , was triggering an increase in capital spending plans .

As construction activity has gained some momentum this spring , shortages of skilled workers and bricklayers are beginning to show up . However , such shortages are not viewed by homebuilders as an insurmountable problem and apprentice programs are bulging . Homebuilders are beginning to express some fear about a sharp decline in home demand in the future . Their special concerns are the possibility of disintermediation , rising mortgage rates , and the continuation of sharply rising costs of building supplies . Builders report that the cost of building materials rose about 15 percent last year . Representatives of some savings and loan associations reported a net outflow of deposits in April . This was said to reflect improved yields on short- and medium-term securities as well as renewed interest in the stock market . Representatives of the savings and loan industry report increased advertising budgets and more offerings of premiums in an attempt to maintain or advance their market share of savings . With strong demand for mortgages , considerable upward pressure has been placed on mortgage interest rates . Rates have advanced about 1/4 of one percentage point in the St. Louis and Memphis areas since last month .

Considerable concern was also expressed by savings and loan representatives about the recent action of the Federal Reserve which allows automatic transfers between savings and demand accounts",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:28:01.8640758Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": -0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 1552, 2323, 29899, 11922, 9999, 869, 450, 2919, 1797, 1250, 1188, 310, 716, 17774, 297, 278, 624, 29889, 5899, 4038, 756, 451, 3447, 16317, 666, 630, 1919, 9432, 292, 7572, 4549, 3271, 16538, 869, 1094, 7632, 6354, 756, 17515, 777, 19399, 445, 6709, 1919, 3273, 1179, 310, 2071, 24455, 17162, 322, 28645, 29277, 526, 6763, 304, 1510, 701, 869, 2398, 1919, 1316, 3273, 1179, 526, 451, 24774, 491, 3271, 4282, 414, 408, 385, 1663, 332, 16476, 519, 1108, 322, 623, 7771, 625, 11104, 526, 8227, 3460, 869, 8778, 4282, 414, 526, 6763, 304, 4653, 777, 8866, 1048, 263, 15301, 4845, 457, 297, 3271, 9667, 297, 278, 5434, 869, 11275, 4266, 21838, 526, 278, 13331, 310, 766, 1639, 4210, 362, 1919, 20493, 5758, 29887, 482, 19257, 1919, 322, 278, 3133, 362, 310, 15301, 368, 20493, 21544, 310, 5214, 28075, 869, 8878, 414, 3461, 393, 278, 3438, 310, 5214, 17279, 11492, 1048, 29871, 29896, 29945, 10151, 1833, 1629, 869, 28757, 310, 777, 4048, 886, 322, 24806, 27733, 8967, 263, 7787, 714, 1731, 310, 19754, 1169, 297, 3786, 869, 910, 471, 1497, 304, 9432, 16710, 17498, 373, 3273, 29899, 322, 18350, 29899, 8489, 409, 2764, 1907, 408, 1532, 408, 23011, 287, 4066, 297, 278, 10961, 9999, 869, 28757, 310, 278, 4048, 886, 322, 24806, 13661, 3461, 11664, 18811, 5921, 8619, 20078, 322, 901, 5957, 886, 310, 5188, 21425, 297, 385, 4218, 304, 7344, 470, 6564, 1009, 9999, 6232, 310, 4048, 886, 869, 2973, 4549, 9667, 363, 5758, 29887, 1179, 1919, 15620, 701, 1328, 12959, 756, 1063, 7180, 373, 5758, 29887, 482, 4066, 19257, 869, 390, 1078, 505, 12862, 1048, 29871, 29896, 29914, 29946, 310, 697, 19649, 1298, 297, 278, 624, 29889, 5899, 322, 341, 7278, 275, 10161, 1951, 1833, 4098, 869, 13, 13, 13696, 1241, 519, 5932, 471, 884, 13384, 491, 4048, 886, 322, 24806, 2755, 5056, 1048, 278, 7786, 3158, 310, 278, 14879, 27811, 607, 6511, 18428, 1301, 25534, 1546, 4048, 886, 322, 9667, 15303, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29908, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 825275500, 'load_duration': 10385700, 'prompt_eval_count': 374, 'prompt_eval_duration': 336002000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 474173000}",0.3,-0.5,-0.3,0.2,0.5

Additionally , new Comprehensive Employment Training Act regulations that limit CETA employment to 18 months , effective October 1 , and heavy federal budget cuts will nudge unemployment even higher at a time of anticipated slow economic activity .

Tourists dealt with higher gasoline prices by continuing to visit attractions within a shorter driving range . Campground business remains very weak throughout the District because of a reluctance to travel too far with gas-guzzling recreational vehicles . Abundant rainfall throughout the District has enhanced yield prospects for crops , particularly soybeans , corn , peanuts , and cotton , and improved pastures . Resultant higher quality pastures helped maintain the good physical condition of cattle herds during the hot summer months .

179,"part of the region reports a strong inflow of large CDs . Professors Eckstein , Houthakker , and Solow were available for comment this month . All three respondents agreed that the moderate third quarter rebound does not signal the end of the recession , although there is disagreement about the appropriate course for monetary policy at the present time . They are puzzled about the recent turmoil in the foreign exchange , gold , and commodity markets , and they offer conflicting advice on how to deal with it . Professor Eckstein believes that the third quarter 's growth was achieved at the cost of a more severe downturn in the months ahead . He expects inflation to continue near its current pace for several more months , however , despite the imminent slowdown . In Eckstein ' s view , the decline of the dollar on foreign exchange markets is primarily the result of domestic economic performance .

However , a supplier to the appliance industry reports that orders have tended to weaken and backlogs reduced in recent weeks . An economist for an aluminum producer views the decline in orders for packaging materials as an indication of a further slowdown . Finally , a retailer believes some softness in overall business sales stems from tight control over inventories , and hence new orders , by retailers .

High interest rates , however , have slowed mortgage warehousing activity as mortgage bankers face negative spreads between the yields on the mortgages they sell and the rates they must pay for short-term financing . Lending activity at District banks remains strong in most other loan categories , although the rate of growth has ebbed to the slowest pace this year . Loan demands by customers outside the District remain weaker than regional demands . Several bankers have expressed concern over unfair competition from foreign banks . They cite the ability of these banks to undercut prices because of differences in regulation . Preliminary results from our latest survey of agribankers indicate the financial positions of District farmers are much improved from a year ago . The improvement is attributed primarily to larger crop yields and higher grain prices . Although farm loan demand remains strong , bankers report fewer loan extensions and an improved rate of loan repayment over the same period last year . The rise of interest rates nationally to levels above usury ceilings on loans to unincorporated businesses in Texas and New Mexico is substantially restricting some farmers ' and ranchers ' access to credit .

For the longer term , more of the same is expected . Nine out of 10 manufacturers are projecting higher inputs costs six months out , and 3 out of 4 are planning to boost the prices of the goods they sell . Third District retailers report some growth in sales in September , but not enough to yield an increase after adjusting for inflation . Reports of current sales levels range from 3 to 6 percent over year- ago figures—about as expected on average . Merchants point to higher outlays by consumers for gasoline and an overall lack of confidence in the economy as factors that are keeping a lid on sales at this point .

198,"August 5 , 1980 The economy of the Eleventh District continues to expand slowly in the current recession . A survey of department stores showed little improvement in unit sales , while sales of new cars have picked up slightly from their previously very depressed levels . Some pickup in speculative residential building is underway , and nonresidential construction continues its relatively strong pace . Lending at most S & L 's and commercial banks is showing slight response to declining interest rates . Manufacturing output is soft , with some improvement in orders from suppliers to the construction industry . Drought conditions are having substantial impact on agricultural production in the District . Unit sales at department stores throughout most of the District remain lackluster , although stores in the Houston and Austin areas report increases from last year 's levels . Credit sales are rebounding from the low level following March 14 but remains a smaller proportion of total sales than in the previous year . Department stores continue to rely heavily on sales and promotions to generate store traffic and move merchandise . Inventory levels are generally described as desirable , although a few retailers have excess stock where sales have not met projections . The outlook for the rest of the year is optimistic , with an aggressive sales push planned for the Christmas season .

199,". Recent sales have been helped by an increased availability of funds at GMAC and Ford Motor Credit Company . The number of auto loans are also up a bit at a number of District banks . Bankers report many inquiries for terms on auto loans , but most are reluctant to borrow at the prevailing 14.5- percent annual rate . The decline in interest rates has reduced inventory costs for dealers , but weak sales forced the bankruptcy of a major Dallas Ford dealer last month . The outlook for residential construction has improved slightly . Inventories of unsold new homes are not excessive . Sales of both new and used homes have picked up slightly in the last two months with the decline in mortgage rates and increased availability of municipal bond funding in the District . Corporate relocations to this area also continue to bolster sales . However , the revival in home sales is not yet significant , as some home purchases are being delayed as many potential buyers anticipate further declines in mortgage rates . Prices are reported to be firm , with substantial discounts generally not available .

202,"March 11 , 1980 The REDBOOK reports this month indicate that business activity is holding quite steady in most districts , with few widespread signs of weakness . High technology and defense-related industries are performing particularly well . The major exceptions to this pattern are the housing and automobile industries , which are exhibiting considerable weakness . Most districts report very strong volumes of retail sales—a phenomenon which several reports ascribed to a pervasive `` spend it now '' psychology on the part of consumers . Reports of continued inflation are also widespread . With the exception of home mortgages , loan volumes were reported to be strong in most districts prior to the recent runup in rates . Spotty current reports indicate a subsequent weakening of loan demand . Financial institutions are experiencing considerable conversion of savings deposits into money-market liabilities , and there is widespread concern about the consequent effect on the cost of funds and institutional profitability . The agricultural sector is apparently in good shape in most districts . Most districts report generally strong industrial activity . New York , for example , reports brisk new orders and generally steady activity .

The housing market remains weak , but mortgage rates are now beginning to fall . Until Thanksgiving , New England retail sales in November continued to reflect the weakening economy . As a result , inventories are higher than planned . Since Thanksgiving , retailing has been very mixed . Some areas are showing unexpected strength , and in others , sales have fallen well below the usual seasonal levels . The picture in Massachusetts is complicated by a heavy weekend snowstorm that closed most stores for a day . One merchant cites particular strength in sales of high quality goods , partly a result of that firm 's efforts to attract more high income customers and partly because the recession is affecting high income shoppers less . This is consistent with sales reports showing greater weakness for discount",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:28:24.306581Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 6185, 1096, 29871, 29896, 29953, 1919, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29947, 29896, 2315, 9765, 3864, 297, 278, 3824, 7457, 756, 8062, 6419, 975, 278, 4940, 4098, 322, 263, 4203, 869, 9267, 901, 13734, 1516, 1135, 9670, 505, 9326, 12522, 3204, 29879, 975, 278, 17661, 4259, 869, 450, 3240, 737, 6434, 338, 901, 5189, 304, 24809, 2056, 1951, 1834, 29887, 4357, 1919, 16538, 505, 1063, 4549, 297, 777, 10161, 1919, 8062, 297, 4045, 869, 3115, 1919, 1833, 1629, 278, 17661, 4259, 4689, 14205, 541, 9698, 373, 263, 4549, 4443, 322, 278, 4259, 408, 263, 3353, 471, 3755, 1781, 2056, 372, 338, 9301, 304, 2649, 3447, 565, 445, 338, 10464, 1449, 869, 4649, 737, 414, 526, 10579, 15041, 1048, 11817, 706, 11174, 2056, 1556, 12012, 332, 414, 1919, 15020, 278, 7786, 16611, 593, 595, 1919, 437, 451, 1776, 11817, 3842, 408, 263, 1108, 869, 450, 27261, 9999, 9242, 8062, 1919, 541, 5758, 29887, 482, 19257, 526, 1286, 6763, 304, 6416, 869, 28609, 1834, 29887, 4357, 1919, 1570, 5408, 3240, 737, 16538, 297, 3979, 7572, 304, 9432, 278, 8062, 8333, 26504, 869, 1094, 263, 1121, 1919, 11817, 3842, 526, 6133, 1135, 20458, 869, 4001, 1834, 29887, 4357, 1919, 3240, 737, 292, 756, 1063, 1407, 12849, 869, 3834, 10161, 526, 6445, 15668, 9324, 1919, 322, 297, 4045, 1919, 16538, 505, 19225, 1532, 2400, 278, 9670, 4259, 284, 11174, 869, 450, 7623, 297, 16167, 338, 12092, 491, 263, 9416, 4723, 355, 15007, 303, 555, 393, 5764, 1556, 14422, 363, 263, 2462, 869, 3118, 29055, 274, 3246, 3153, 9324, 297, 16538, 310, 1880, 11029, 22535, 1919, 22669, 263, 1121, 310, 393, 9226, 525, 29879, 14231, 304, 13978, 901, 1880, 17869, 20330, 322, 22669, 1363, 278, 337, 985, 291, 338, 6602, 292, 1880, 17869, 528, 9354, 414, 3109, 869, 910, 338, 13747, 411, 16538, 13676, 6445, 7621, 8062, 2264, 363, 2313, 792, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 822084800, 'load_duration': 5278500, 'prompt_eval_count': 355, 'prompt_eval_duration': 323175000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 491634000}",-0.6,-0.6,-0.3,-0.5,-0.5
206,"ahead to 1982 , the executives were almost unanimous in forecasting an improved year at home but only half expected an upturn abroad . One positive development in this month 's reports is evidence of further progress in bringing down the rate of inflation . Only a third of purchasing managers surveyed reported prices increased in the past month ; earlier in the year and for most of 1980 , two-thirds normally reported higher prices . Commodity prices have softened and are expected to remain soft for some time . Not everyone is happy about lower prices : the building materials executive reports that although costs are up , his firm has been forced to price its products below 1980 levels . Professors Houthakker and Samuelson were available for comment this month . Houthakker is disappointed that fiscal policy for 1982 will not reduce the budget deficit , and he sympathizes somewhat with our foreign trading partners who object to domestic policies . Nevertheless , he believes there is no need to change monetary policy at this time . Houthakker recommends a temporary shift of attention to M-2 if a conflict should arise between attaining the M-2 guideline and the M-1B guideline . Once the NOW account adjustment is complete and the M-2 and M-1B guidelines are once again mutually consistent , the Fed should return its attention to M-1B . Houthakker wonders how much of recent M-2 growth is due to the increase in money market mutual fund balances . The Fed might consider levying",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:28:25.2195772Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 29874, 2813, 304, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29947, 29906, 1919, 278, 6704, 3145, 892, 4359, 443, 11576, 681, 297, 29821, 579, 292, 385, 16710, 1629, 472, 3271, 541, 871, 4203, 3806, 385, 318, 415, 595, 28177, 869, 3118, 6374, 5849, 297, 445, 4098, 525, 29879, 13676, 338, 10757, 310, 4340, 6728, 297, 20794, 1623, 278, 6554, 310, 4414, 362, 869, 9333, 263, 4654, 310, 10596, 5832, 767, 18150, 18994, 287, 8967, 26094, 11664, 297, 278, 4940, 4098, 2056, 8859, 297, 278, 1629, 322, 363, 1556, 310, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29947, 29900, 1919, 1023, 29899, 22585, 29879, 12891, 8967, 6133, 26094, 869, 422, 1545, 537, 26094, 505, 4964, 6419, 322, 526, 3806, 304, 3933, 4964, 363, 777, 931, 869, 2216, 14332, 338, 9796, 1048, 5224, 26094, 584, 278, 5214, 17279, 22760, 13676, 393, 5998, 21544, 526, 701, 1919, 670, 9226, 756, 1063, 11826, 304, 8666, 967, 9316, 2400, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29947, 29900, 11174, 869, 6175, 404, 943, 379, 2438, 557, 3946, 322, 15316, 1100, 892, 3625, 363, 3440, 445, 4098, 869, 379, 2438, 557, 3946, 338, 23451, 287, 393, 16436, 1052, 8898, 363, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29947, 29906, 674, 451, 10032, 278, 23562, 822, 293, 277, 1919, 322, 540, 17520, 7093, 10579, 411, 1749, 9117, 3534, 292, 22056, 1058, 1203, 304, 21849, 24833, 869, 25678, 1919, 540, 1339, 17180, 727, 338, 694, 817, 304, 1735, 1601, 300, 653, 8898, 472, 445, 931, 869, 379, 2438, 557, 3946, 5052, 1975, 263, 13201, 9500, 310, 8570, 304, 341, 29899, 29906, 565, 263, 14529, 881, 29030, 1546, 1098, 17225, 278, 341, 29899, 29906, 16605, 5570, 322, 278, 341, 29899, 29896, 29933, 16605, 5570, 869, 9038, 278, 405, 9806, 3633, 10365, 358, 338, 4866, 322, 278, 341, 29899, 29906, 322, 341, 29899, 29896, 29933, 1410, 10652, 1475, 526, 2748, 1449, 5478, 1474, 13747, 1919, 278, 17972, 881, 736, 967, 8570, 304, 341, 29899, 29896, 29933, 869, 379, 2438, 557, 3946, 281, 18452, 920, 1568, 310, 7786, 341, 29899, 29906, 14321, 338, 2861, 304, 278, 7910, 297, 6909, 9999, 5478, 950, 5220, 6411, 2925, 869, 450, 17972, 1795, 2050, 14453, 5414, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 908463200, 'load_duration': 4352000, 'prompt_eval_count': 396, 'prompt_eval_duration': 344347000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 556558000}",0.7,0.6,0.3,0.5,0.6

Overall manufacturing activity , as measured by the Fourth District 's Survey of Manufacturing , is expected to continue to expand into the second quarter , based on strength in new orders , shipments and employment . However , a loss of momentum is also suggested by the reduction in the number of firms expecting increases in each of these indexes , except shipments , during April . Prices Moderation in the first quarter GNP implicit price deflator has not altered inflation expectations . Decelerating prices , anticipated by several Roundtable economists , have been enhanced by rebate programs in the auto industry and declining demand for gasoline . While most items except energy increased at a reduced rate in the first quarter of 1981 , the underlying inflation rate remains about 9 % -10 % , according to an auto economist . A producer of consumer nondurables expects meat prices to increase during the summer , following the stepped-up slaughtering of cattle in recent weeks . Food prices in general may be helped by expected good weather , but rising costs could lead to upward pressures on prices by year-end . A trade economist expects inflation to move below double-digit rates by the end of the year , but he also expects slower progress over the longer term because of the insensitivity of wage costs .

212,"January 28 , 1981 Overview Business conditions in the Tenth District continue to show little strength . Softness in retail sales is expected to continue for a while , and the short-term outlook for auto sales is viewed as poor . Inventories of retailers and manufacturers are higher than desired . The winter wheat crop is in some danger due to lack of moisture . Loan demand at commercial banks has weakened recently , with loans to the energy industry an exception . Retail Sales and Inventories Most Tenth District retailers indicate that total dollar sales in 1980 were 5-10 per cent greater than in 1979 . But sales in December 1980 and January 1981 have not shown that much strength in most areas of the District . Sales have been strongest in durable goods and higher priced items , primarily quality apparel . Most retailers expect the current softness of total sales to continue , at least through the first and second quarters . A majority of retailers continue to report negligible merchandise cost increases in recent months are reducing upward pressure on retail prices . Most retailers note recent downward pressure on profit margins because of increases in advertising expenditures , utility bills , and other operational expenses .

213,"sluggishness in various sectors of the district economy has recently been complicated by strikes . The district , like the rest of the country , is experiencing slower deliveries and less travel- related business because of the air traffic controllers ' strike . The district is also being adversely affected by several other labor disputes . Since mid-July , 14,000 State of Minnesota workers have been on strike , reducing state services . In addition , labor disputes between residential builders and carpenters and between foundries and workers have been slowing down construction and manufacturing activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area . Financial Activity The sluggishness in the district 's economy is manifested in weak bank lending . Loans at Minneapolis-St. Paul area banks in June and July were essentially unchanged from their lackluster level this past spring .

215,"August 11 , 1981 Economic activity in the Second District weakened a bit in July . Retail sales slowed from the brisk pace of previous months , and automobile demand remained fairly lackluster . New orders for capital goods continued to taper off . The strength of the dollar is worrying exporters , but so far few specific comments on export sales losses have been picked up . The overall economic outlook is mixed . While personal tax cuts are expected to boost department store sales by the end of 1981 , automobile sales and capital spending are expected to remain weak until interest rates fall significantly . On the financial side , major banks reported substantial increases in levels of credit lines intended for merger activity . Consumer Spending In July , retail activity in the Second District fell from the generally high levels of May and June . While several department store chains indicated that sales were at or above plan , performances at all retail stores were weaker than those of last month .

The number of operating drilling rigs is still falling , and the seismic crew count , a leading indicator of drilling activity , has resumed its downward trend . Both the number and total footage of wells drilled fell for the second consecutive month . Low oil prices are decreasing natural gas demand . Thus , many energy companies are lowering their projected expenditures for exploration during 1983 . Production in the manufacturing sector generally appears to have stabilized at low levels . Most firms have already made the necessary cutbacks in production and employment . Petroleum refineries and chemical plants are operating at roughly two-thirds of capacity and are expected to continue at that rate . A sharp August drop in steel orders for commercial construction was partially offset by an increase in orders for residential construction . However , inventories of oil field equipment continue to climb . Conditions in the electronics and apparel industries are unchanged . Electronics sales are being supported by the defense industry , and orders for apparel products are less than the seasonal norm . Outstanding loans at commercial banks in the District increased 1.1 percent in August , up from a sluggish 0.1-percent gain in July . Loan growth for the year-to-date is substantially above average .

General merchandise sales also have remained weak in the Ninth District , according to this Bank 's directors and Minneapolis-St. Paul retailers . However , two Twin Cities retailers indicate that furniture and appliances ( reported weak in previous Redbooks ) showed some signs of improvement in October . This improvement is attributed to price cutting and heavy advertising , though , not to reduced finance charges . Industrial Activity Recent layoffs and plant closings suggest that district manufacturers have continued to retrench . In computer manufacturing , a large Minneapolis company recently announced that its work force will be reduced by 1,850 , and another plans temporary fourth quarter shutdowns affecting 9,000 workers . In heavy equipment manufacturing , a construction equipment firm permanently closed a plant in Minnesota , and a North Dakota tractor manufacturer laid off 80 people . In consumer products manufacturing , an apparel firm permanently closed a plant in Minnesota , and a major microwave oven manufacturer recently shut down its South Dakota plant for three or four weeks . The metal mining and lumbering industries generally have continued to operate at low production levels .

222,"large iron mining company recalled about 1,800 workers in early March , another laid off 2,100 workers for eight weeks . Besides that , energy production , which had long been a source of strength for the district , weakened recently . Due to the glut in petroleum supplies , oil exploration slowed at the western end of the district . A Montana director said that in early March 100 oil rigs were idle in eastern Montana and western North Dakota . Directors also said that the forest products industry at both ends of the district remained very depressed . Agricultural Conditions Recent changes in the prices of farm products indicate possible recovery for about half the district 's farmers—those who produce livestock—but not for the other half . Between January and early March , the prices farmers receive for hogs and cattle at South St. Paul rose about 7 percent . One director attributed part of the rise to unusually harsh winter weather restricting the flow of livestock to market . But the price rise may not be as temporary as that explanation would indicate : an economist associated with the livestock industry attributed part of the rise to livestock herds being smaller than anticipated . Crop farmers have n't had to face this ambiguity about their price situation . Cash crop prices at Minneapolis were essentially unchanged between January and early March , and they were considerably below their year-earlier levels . Weak demand seemed to be keeping these prices down , for the",-0.6,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:28:36.7244197Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.6}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 16961, 13977, 1375, 292, 5001, 337, 13998, 1048, 29871, 29896, 29892, 29947, 29900, 29900, 17162, 297, 4688, 4779, 1919, 1790, 12341, 1283, 29871, 29906, 29892, 29896, 29900, 29900, 17162, 363, 9475, 11405, 869, 19065, 393, 1919, 5864, 5802, 1919, 607, 750, 1472, 1063, 263, 2752, 310, 9324, 363, 278, 6474, 1919, 8062, 6419, 10325, 869, 16809, 304, 278, 3144, 329, 297, 5697, 12154, 398, 28075, 1919, 17182, 3902, 12418, 5232, 287, 472, 278, 15782, 1095, 310, 278, 6474, 869, 319, 4526, 1648, 8881, 1497, 393, 297, 4688, 4779, 29871, 29896, 29900, 29900, 17182, 12912, 29879, 892, 28132, 297, 18632, 4526, 1648, 322, 15782, 4644, 22679, 4616, 869, 8797, 943, 884, 1497, 393, 278, 13569, 9316, 13661, 472, 1716, 10614, 310, 278, 6474, 9488, 1407, 316, 13120, 869, 27051, 3631, 11790, 2187, 3599, 296, 3620, 297, 278, 26094, 310, 17888, 9316, 12266, 1950, 24205, 363, 1048, 4203, 278, 6474, 525, 29879, 2215, 13269, 30003, 386, 852, 1058, 7738, 7294, 342, 1698, 30003, 4187, 451, 363, 278, 916, 4203, 869, 21674, 5490, 322, 4688, 4779, 1919, 278, 26094, 2215, 13269, 7150, 363, 298, 12099, 322, 27498, 472, 4275, 624, 29889, 3739, 11492, 1048, 29871, 29955, 10151, 869, 3118, 8881, 29393, 760, 310, 278, 14451, 304, 18325, 1474, 4023, 845, 13851, 14826, 9250, 292, 278, 4972, 310, 7294, 342, 1698, 304, 9999, 869, 1205, 278, 8666, 14451, 1122, 451, 367, 408, 13201, 408, 393, 8252, 723, 12266, 584, 385, 7766, 391, 6942, 411, 278, 7294, 342, 1698, 13661, 29393, 760, 310, 278, 14451, 304, 7294, 342, 1698, 902, 6289, 1641, 7968, 1135, 23483, 630, 869, 315, 1336, 2215, 13269, 505, 302, 29915, 29873, 750, 304, 3700, 445, 22363, 537, 1048, 1009, 8666, 6434, 869, 315, 1161, 274, 1336, 26094, 472, 3080, 484, 25332, 892, 13674, 443, 15033, 1546, 5490, 322, 4688, 4779, 1919, 322, 896, 892, 2050, 2197, 2400, 1009, 1629, 29899, 799, 4926, 11174, 869, 1334, 557, 9667, 6140, 304, 367, 12515, 1438, 26094, 1623, 1919, 363, 278, 32007, 32001, 8853, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29953, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 702789700, 'load_duration': 5746000, 'prompt_eval_count': 377, 'prompt_eval_duration': 333753000, 'eval_count': 11, 'eval_duration': 360315000}",0.3,-0.6,-0.6,-0.5,-0.5
223,"December 15 , 1982 Overview Economic activity in most Districts showed some signs of improvement except in the manufacturing sector . Weakness in manufacturing remained pervasive with some further layoffs reported and , for the most part , little or no upturn in new orders . Consumer spending strengthened in November but several Districts noted sluggish early-December sales . Housing sales and starts registered gains in most regions although the oversupply of office space kept nonresidential construction generally slow . In several agricultural areas a further decline in farm income and land values overshadowed the few bright spots that appeared . Commercial bank lending was essentially flat in most reporting Districts . The general outlook ranges from a slight upturn during the next six months to little pickup until late 1983 . Consumer Spending Since the last report , consumer expenditures posted some gains on both a month-to-month and year-over-year basis , helped in part by promotional activity . Nonetheless , no real exuberance was displayed . Auto sales picked up in several areas in response to lower finance charges but these lower rates are scheduled to end soon . With regard to the overall outlook for retail sales during the holiday season , the most optimistic report was from Boston ( `` solid but unspectacular '' ) .

Business liquidity continues to deteriorate ; profits will remain under extreme pressure , while no balance sheet restructuring has materialized during this recession . Many additional downgradings of business credit ratings are likely to be announced in the forthcoming months . Interest rates will continue to be highly volatile . The long-term bond markets in particular will be challenged by a lack of liquidity in business , the huge Treasury cash needs , and a firm monetary policy . Maude : Most likely developments over the spring and early summer months should place renewed severe upward pressure on interest rates with long-term yields retesting their 1981 highs in a financial crisis type environment . These developments should manifest themselves in the form of a highly anemic economic recovery , some modest pick-up in private credit demands , a cash flow squeeze in the nonfinancial corporate sector , continued strains on financial intermediaries , credit quality concerns and a reluctance on the part of investors to make long-term fixed income commitments . The underlying causes of these difficulties should be an April and July surge in money growth , a resulting monetary tightening , huge actual Treasury financing ( especially during the third quarter ) and continued apprehension over the out-year budgetary deficits .

231,"August and , with 2 1/2-year small savers certificates , accounted for most of the growth in savings capital at S & Ls . Time deposits and jumbo CDs contributed the largest shares to September 's deposit gains at banks . In contrast , loan activity at large southeastern banks slowed significantly in September after advancing throughout the summer . Business lending , which failed to register a gain from August to September , was the primary source of this deceleration . However , consumer lending increased in September for the seventh consecutive month . A money center bank is backing Florida legislation to allow out-of- state financial institutions to establish de novo operations in the state , thereby permitting out-of-state banks to enter the market without acquiring existing institutions . The proposal is a response to a legislative initiative by Florida bankers to limit out-of-state banking to institutions from regional states with similar reciprocal agreements . Tourism The industry is entering its traditionally slow fall season after a summer that proved to be generally positive , except in south Florida , middle and east Tennessee , and New Orleans . Hotels and motels increased revenues in August even though occupancy levels were below comparable 1982 levels in many District cities . Hotel construction in central Florida and the apparently rapid absorption of expensive resort properties along Florida 's north Atlantic coast augur continued growth in these areas .

Shopping center construction in Florida and Louisiana is characterized as steady with good prospects for picking up in the near future . Finance Legislators in Florida and Tennessee have effectively defeated bills to allow interstate banking in their respective states . Proponents of the Florida legislation maintained that interstate banking would provide more capital for loans , expand the state 's tax base , and create some healthy competition . Although tabled , the Florida bill could come up later this year . Advocates of the Tennessee legislation argued that out-of-state acquisition of some local banks would relieve the lack of confidence in the state 's financial industry caused by the failure of United American Bank ( UAB ) . Bankers claim the FDIC 's failure to honor loan participations purchased by Tennessee and Kentucky banks from the now defunct UAB could further weaken some already shaken institutions .

The only bright spot in the housing sector , according to builders and realtors , is an increase in traffic—interested buyers —which began near the end of September , and which may eventually result in actual orders and sales . Vacancy rates in commercial buildings remain extremely high with declines contingent on an improved local economy . Despite this high vacancy rate , construction is continuing on several office building projects throughout the District . Commercial Banking Banks in the Fourth District reduced their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities , state and local government securities and federal funds in recent weeks . An increase in loan demand , in conjunction with a marked slowdown in deposit growth , may explain the reduction in bank investments . Virtually all of the increase in loan volume at district banks was in the commercial and industrial loan category . All categories of deposits were essentially flat . Banks in the District generally have not been aggressive about the new deregulated time deposits and hence have not experienced much shifting of deposits and have not attracted new deposits .",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:28:47.5600308Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 22899, 304, 4866, 278, 1797, 1250, 1188, 18414, 7964, 445, 4940, 7206, 869, 830, 1997, 943, 5352, 278, 3839, 4845, 457, 297, 16538, 304, 1880, 5758, 29887, 482, 19257, 869, 450, 871, 11785, 9758, 297, 278, 27261, 17535, 1919, 5034, 304, 2048, 414, 322, 1855, 29873, 943, 1919, 338, 385, 7910, 297, 12469, 30003, 1639, 2868, 15649, 414, 813, 4716, 4689, 2978, 278, 1095, 310, 3839, 1919, 322, 607, 1122, 10201, 1121, 297, 3935, 11299, 322, 16538, 869, 478, 562, 6906, 19257, 297, 12128, 13814, 3933, 14154, 1880, 411, 4845, 1475, 640, 292, 296, 373, 385, 16710, 1887, 26504, 869, 19454, 445, 1880, 11757, 6906, 6554, 1919, 7632, 338, 3133, 292, 373, 3196, 8034, 5214, 9279, 10106, 278, 7457, 869, 422, 1050, 1455, 10253, 292, 350, 1331, 297, 278, 12458, 386, 7457, 12212, 1009, 4808, 886, 310, 501, 29889, 29903, 29889, 6479, 294, 2857, 409, 2764, 1907, 1919, 2106, 322, 1887, 5874, 409, 2764, 1907, 322, 17097, 29199, 297, 7786, 11405, 869, 530, 7910, 297, 24806, 9667, 1919, 297, 9589, 651, 411, 263, 10902, 5232, 3204, 297, 19754, 277, 14321, 1919, 1122, 5649, 278, 20376, 297, 9124, 13258, 1860, 869, 478, 2728, 1474, 599, 310, 278, 7910, 297, 24806, 7977, 472, 6474, 24388, 471, 297, 278, 12128, 322, 18408, 24806, 7663, 869, 2178, 13997, 310, 19754, 1169, 892, 13674, 12151, 869, 350, 1331, 297, 278, 7457, 6892, 505, 451, 1063, 946, 3663, 573, 1048, 278, 716, 589, 387, 7964, 931, 19754, 1169, 322, 8151, 505, 451, 18860, 1568, 528, 24377, 310, 19754, 1169, 322, 505, 451, 13978, 287, 716, 19754, 1169, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 769206900, 'load_duration': 4953800, 'prompt_eval_count': 313, 'prompt_eval_duration': 270857000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 490274000}",0.35,0.2,-0.2,0.2,0.2

Employment , hours worked , shipments , new orders , and order backlogs are flat . Inventories continue to fall and about 20 % of firms report increases in prices they pay for materials , components , and services . A survey of purchasing managers in the Cincinnati area indicates a steady slowing in April and May in the rate of gain in production , new orders , and order backlogs . Inventories of raw materials and finished goods are falling . Firms report a decline in employment in May after two months of increases . Manufacturing of light trucks and automobiles , especially large autos , is strong . Producers of these vehicles and their components report expanding hours and employment , but remain cautious about building inventories . Production of parts for the auto after-market , which remained fairly steady during the recession , is rising slowly . Tire manufacturing is improving mildly . Tire manufacturers report shipments of original equipment auto tires up substantially over last year in line with improved new car sales , while replacement tire shipments are up only slightly .

All fall harvested crops were adversely affected by insect damage . Furthermore , New Mexico 's milo , peanut , and cotton crops were reported to have been damaged by premature frost and hail . The planting of winter wheat is nearly complete in most district states and the crop is generally reported to be in good condition . But in isolated parts of Oklahoma , winter wheat may need to be reseeded due to recent flooding . Livestock prices continue to fall as marketings have increased due to rising feed costs and poor pasture conditions . No widespread liquidation of herds , however , is reported . Sales of farm equipment and farm inputs continue to be abnormally slow . The expected yearend increase in demand for farm equipment has not yet materialized , and probably will not .

Automobile Dealers Most respondents report a small but broad-based increase in auto sales compared with sales in the same period of last year . The growth in auto sales is attributed to low interest rates offered by manufacturers ' finance companies .

243,"February 2 , 1983 Overview Business firms in the Tenth District are expecting a slow recovery to get underway during the second or third quarter of 1983 . Recent stable prices are expected to rise slightly as 1983 moves along . Inventories are generally lean and are likely to remain so in the near future . Farmers and agricultural lenders are somewhat more optimistic about conditions in the agricultural sector , due partly to the expected response to the newly announced farm program . Loan demand at commercial banks is generally flat , while deposit growth is up because of strong growth in the new money market deposit accounts . Retail Trade All respondents indicate that nominal sales for 1982 as a whole were slightly higher ( 5 percent or less ) than those in 1981 . Sales in the final quarter of 1982 were between 5 and 10 percent higher than a year earlier . The strength in retail sales has come mainly in soft goods , with big-ticket items still very weak .

Current reports on business loan volume range from 11 percent below to 14 percent above a year ago , much the same as they were six weeks ago . According to contacts , increased corporate profits have sufficiently improved cash flow at many companies , permitting more internal financing and preventing any real firming of commercial loan demand . Loan activity on the retail side continues to improve , but recent gains are not as strong as earlier in the year . Although consumer lending is now as much as 11 percent ahead of last September , lenders say rising interest rates have taken some of the edge off the demand for consumer loans . Area banking officials foresee gradual improvement in overall lending activity over the next six months . C & I loan demand is expected to gain strength slowly through next March as commercial investment expands beyond the funds available internally . Most bankers also predict that consumer demand for credit will expand further despite the likelihood of slightly higher interest rates . Many lenders plan to maintain their aggressive marketing posture . The prime rate charged by major Third District banks has risen to 11 percent in September from 10.5 percent in early August . Local seers are predicting that , because of positive reports on inflation and the money supply , upward movement in interest rates over the next six months will remain sluggish ..

There is almost no expectation , however , of any significant short term changes .",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:28:54.682042Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 3752, 1857, 19257, 310, 18414, 2785, 310, 716, 1919, 9644, 1025, 27261, 10340, 869, 1670, 338, 1407, 2217, 3585, 310, 5758, 29887, 482, 19257, 1438, 3841, 869, 422, 1050, 1455, 322, 18408, 7632, 6354, 338, 1603, 5839, 292, 701, 10579, 1919, 541, 716, 6354, 338, 15155, 16424, 869, 9038, 1449, 1919, 3138, 1919, 2149, 800, 526, 6892, 6374, 869, 7849, 10049, 1237, 363, 968, 29872, 7572, 878, 342, 330, 2708, 297, 315, 669, 306, 7632, 6354, 297, 6421, 7378, 869, 739, 881, 367, 11682, 1919, 2466, 1919, 393, 8034, 2913, 9242, 297, 19163, 297, 777, 25311, 8929, 10161, 869, 10253, 292, 322, 4231, 749, 4231, 273, 1455, 21561, 505, 13229, 1898, 1407, 2898, 304, 7985, 658, 550, 10325, 869, 21882, 10049, 1237, 505, 7829, 869, 278, 12463, 16200, 11029, 310, 1009, 2011, 4542, 2363, 756, 4845, 1312, 408, 263, 1121, 310, 1009, 2534, 18365, 3926, 25734, 22558, 310, 27942, 414, 869, 2180, 3203, 22669, 408, 263, 1121, 310, 1438, 5855, 297, 278, 24806, 2791, 1691, 1919, 7786, 6576, 297, 278, 589, 387, 2785, 310, 19754, 1169, 2615, 304, 505, 750, 2217, 2779, 373, 2845, 21561, 470, 1009, 20330, 869, 450, 1556, 17644, 3806, 2779, 1919, 6577, 3460, 515, 6589, 515, 2820, 278, 7457, 1919, 338, 263, 5520, 1840, 1791, 1247, 3864, 310, 18161, 21561, 525, 619, 11614, 869, 1670, 338, 4359, 694, 23227, 1919, 3138, 1919, 310, 738, 7282, 3273, 1840, 3620, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 740642200, 'load_duration': 4513200, 'prompt_eval_count': 284, 'prompt_eval_duration': 233189000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 506237000}",0.55,0.3,0.2,-0.2,0.3

Agriculture Crop damage in the District from the hot dry weather was the largest in years . Many crops were completely wiped out ; farmers in most counties sustained some damage , and in a number of counties output will be less than half of last year . Corn , soybeans , tobacco , alfalfa , cotton , fruits and vegetables were all hurt , and many chickens and some hogs died . Financial losses to many individual farmers and rural communities have been severe . Meat and other food prices are likely to rise over the next year because of the reduced supplies . The lower yields , reinforcing the PIK program acreage cuts , are reducing the large overhang of inventories . Commodity prices have risen , bolstering total farm income .

Employment levels are rising for most firms , although one respondent foresees a large layoff in one division . Several manufacturers noted that they are producing more output with fewer people than in the past . Price increases seem to be more frequent . Most firms say they see more increases in the prices of purchased materials and components . Paper , steel and aluminum were mentioned . Several of the firms contacted have recently increased their own prices . Nevertheless , manufacturers are still very cautious about raising prices and will back off if the increase meets a lot of resistance . According to an automotive supplier , the auto companies are negotiating long-term contracts with price decreases in the first year and very modest increases thereafter . One respondent expressed concern that the wage settlement to be negotiated between GM and the UAW in 1984 will be very large and will set a pattern for other industries . Mortgage Lending Mortgage lending by thrift institutions declined in the fourth quarter but remained far above the level in the fourth quarter of 1982 .

251,"December 5 , 1984 Summary Total business activity in the Seventh District has been about stable since early this year , having flattened earlier than in the nation . Most District reports suggest relative stability in the months ahead , but concern has been growing that a general deterioration is underway . Auto production has returned to a high level , but only slightly above last year . Steel output has improved since late September , but remains well below the first half rate , and below break-even levels . Machine tool orders are up , mainly from the auto industry . Heavy construction and farm equipment makers , faced with weak markets , are selling off units and closing marginal plants . Cutbacks are occurring in the important health care industry , reversing a long-term expansion . Container loadings on flat cars , which had slowed earlier in the year , slipped significantly in November . Demand for most mechanical capital equipment remains weak . Sales of heavy trucks and trailers have softened recently from high levels . However , surveys show sizable additions to capital outlays next year by the auto and steel industries . Many lines of seasonal retail merchandise are reported moving well , but the 2-year boom in consumer hardgoods apparently has run its course . Retail inventories are viewed as excessive , encouraging price markdowns . Recent declines in paperboard demand partly reflect reduced orders for general merchandise .

Residential construction continues to weaken , while nonresidential construction is expanding",-0.45,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:28:58.8606207Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.45\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 6185, 1096, 29871, 29945, 1919, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29947, 29946, 6991, 5219, 14990, 5381, 6354, 297, 278, 922, 794, 29882, 7457, 756, 1063, 1048, 13714, 1951, 4688, 445, 1629, 1919, 2534, 1652, 8606, 287, 8859, 1135, 297, 278, 5233, 869, 7849, 7457, 13676, 4368, 6198, 25806, 297, 278, 7378, 14432, 1919, 541, 5932, 756, 1063, 15678, 393, 263, 2498, 270, 1308, 1611, 362, 338, 1090, 1582, 869, 11133, 5802, 756, 4133, 304, 263, 1880, 3233, 1919, 541, 871, 10029, 2038, 1833, 1629, 869, 2443, 295, 1962, 756, 16710, 1951, 5683, 3839, 1919, 541, 9242, 1532, 2400, 278, 937, 4203, 6554, 1919, 322, 2400, 2867, 29899, 11884, 11174, 869, 6189, 5780, 11299, 526, 701, 1919, 14364, 515, 278, 4469, 13661, 869, 940, 5301, 7632, 322, 17888, 21083, 2136, 414, 1919, 20050, 411, 8062, 2791, 1691, 1919, 526, 269, 7807, 1283, 10340, 322, 14382, 15276, 979, 18577, 869, 315, 329, 1627, 29879, 526, 13920, 292, 297, 278, 4100, 9045, 2562, 13661, 1919, 18764, 292, 263, 1472, 29899, 8489, 13184, 869, 21679, 2254, 886, 373, 12151, 18647, 1919, 607, 750, 5232, 287, 8859, 297, 278, 1629, 1919, 20662, 2986, 16951, 297, 3979, 869, 4432, 392, 363, 1556, 28310, 7483, 21083, 9242, 8062, 869, 28389, 310, 9416, 534, 2707, 29879, 322, 1020, 22058, 505, 4964, 6419, 10325, 515, 1880, 11174, 869, 2398, 1919, 26946, 952, 1510, 269, 13902, 788, 2187, 304, 7483, 714, 29880, 1036, 2446, 1629, 491, 278, 4469, 322, 22973, 6397, 2722, 869, 9267, 3454, 310, 4259, 284, 3240, 737, 2778, 305, 392, 895, 526, 8967, 8401, 1532, 1919, 541, 278, 29871, 29906, 29899, 6360, 1045, 290, 297, 21691, 2898, 16773, 29879, 13229, 756, 1065, 967, 3236, 869, 4649, 737, 11817, 3842, 526, 24774, 408, 19163, 573, 1919, 18443, 292, 8666, 2791, 3204, 29879, 869, 3599, 296, 4845, 1475, 297, 5650, 3377, 9667, 22669, 9432, 12212, 11299, 363, 2498, 2778, 305, 392, 895, 869, 13, 13, 1666, 1693, 616, 7632, 18172, 304, 8062, 264, 1919, 1550, 1661, 690, 1693, 616, 7632, 338, 7985, 292, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29946, 29945, 13, 29913], 'total_duration': 867296200, 'load_duration': 5007600, 'prompt_eval_count': 383, 'prompt_eval_duration': 341036000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 517407000}",-0.3,0.3,-0.3,0.2,0.1

Our contacts with industries important in the District generally expect relative stability during the rest of 1984 and early 1985—but no precipitous decline . However , some company analysts are warning their managements that the situation is fragile and that a general decline , rather than renewed expansion , is the more likely development . Motor Vehicles Auto makers are planning production at a high level through next year 's first quarter , but with only small gains from year-earlier levels . Weaker auto sales in recent months reflect shortages of popular models . Strikes , unrelated parts shortages , and import quotas have limited supplies . Large `` availability '' premiums are reported on some models , recalling the situation after World War II . Steel Steel production in the Chicago and Detroit areas has improved somewhat from September lows associated with heavy imports , the auto strike , and inventory cutting . However , output remains well below the first half pace . Increasingly . imports have penetrated Midwest markets . usually through steel service centers , often owned by foreign steel producers .

Sales of appliances , led by microwaves , have been `` phenomenal '' . Other hard goods also have done well . Inventories , overall , are now slightly higher than had been budgeted , especially when goods on order are included , but not a cause of concern .

Farm equipment remains very weak . Light construction equipment has improved , but not heavy types . Freight car orders are somewhat higher , but only specialized types , including piggy-back flatcars , auto carriers , and some bulk carriers .

Rehires by motor vehicle and parts plants are by far the most important , but there have also been gains in appliances , mobile homes , and recreational vehicles . Residential construction is also up . In November , all District states , with Michigan far in the lead , reported good gains in factory employment from late 1982. but the shortfall from late 1978 still ranged from 15 percent in Wisconsin to 20 percent in Iowa , and 24 percent in Illinois , Indiana , and Michigan . Total non- manufacturing employment data show no improvement through November . State and local governments , public utilities , and financial institutions are generally hiring only to fill essential vacancies , and many are reducing staff .

255,"October 23 , 1984 Overview Some moderation continues to be apparent in Tenth District economic activity . While retail sales continue to improve , housing activity and mortgage demand have generally slowed . Inventories of retail goods are slightly larger than desired , while inventories of materials inputs are at satisfactory levels . Price increases have been small , and are expected to continue so . Loan demand is increasing slightly at district banks , while deposits remain unchanged . Yields of fall-harvested crops varied across the district while the newly-planted winter wheat crop is in good condition . Retail Trade Retailers report that year-to-date retail sales are up significantly over a year ago , and that sales continued to improve in the past three months . Inventories are slightly larger than desired for some retailers . However , no major trimming is intended , because most retailers are optimistic about sales through the remainder of the year . Prices remained generally flat in recent months , and no significant increases are anticipated through the remainder of the year . Automobile Sales Automobile dealers throughout the Tenth District continue to report improved sales in 1984 relative to last year . Credit market conditions are satisfactory , and financing is available both for floorplanning and car buyers . Most dealers report smaller inventories due mainly to the 1985 model introductions and partially to the GM strike .

Dealers are optimistic about sales for the balance of 1984 and early 1985 .

258,"nut and grape acreage in the San Joaquin Valley area of California . Financial Institutions In August , consumer credit ( not seasonally adjusted ) at large banks in the Twelfth District grew at a 24 percent annual rate . This represented the largest monthly increase in 1984 and offset weakness in commercial and real estate lending . A sample of smaller institutions showed similar behavior . These increases continue the pattern of strong consumer loan growth shown earlier this year . Bankers in the region attribute the strength to improved economic conditions which have boosted consumer purchases of new cars and recreational vehicles . While a number of banks also report strength in home equity loans , others have experienced slow to flat demand for those loans as consumers have shifted to use of personal credit lines and credit cards for financing . The forecast for consumer credit remains mixed . Many banks expect these loans to continue to grow rapidly through year-end . However , an even larger number of institutions expect slower growth in personal income and rising interest rates to cause a slowdown in both consumer spending and borrowing . A few of these already have experienced a falloff in consumer loan demand .",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:29:04.9063875Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 21305, 322, 2646, 412, 263, 1037, 482, 297, 278, 3087, 3650, 18463, 262, 13939, 4038, 310, 8046, 869, 4231, 273, 1455, 28218, 29879, 512, 3111, 1919, 21691, 16200, 313, 451, 4259, 635, 10365, 287, 1723, 472, 2919, 24388, 297, 278, 8168, 761, 386, 7457, 13631, 472, 263, 29871, 29906, 29946, 10151, 17568, 6554, 869, 910, 9875, 278, 10150, 4098, 368, 7910, 297, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29947, 29946, 322, 9210, 8062, 2264, 297, 12128, 322, 1855, 19989, 301, 2548, 869, 319, 4559, 310, 7968, 21561, 10018, 2788, 6030, 869, 4525, 16415, 6773, 278, 4766, 310, 4549, 21691, 24806, 14321, 4318, 8859, 445, 1629, 869, 10253, 414, 297, 278, 5120, 5352, 278, 9324, 304, 16710, 17407, 5855, 607, 505, 14505, 287, 21691, 10596, 2129, 310, 716, 18647, 322, 28709, 1288, 24413, 869, 5806, 263, 1353, 310, 24388, 884, 3461, 9324, 297, 3271, 1592, 537, 658, 550, 1919, 4045, 505, 18860, 5232, 304, 12151, 9667, 363, 1906, 658, 550, 408, 11233, 414, 505, 9500, 287, 304, 671, 310, 7333, 16200, 3454, 322, 16200, 15889, 363, 11782, 3277, 869, 450, 29821, 579, 363, 21691, 16200, 9242, 12849, 869, 9267, 24388, 2149, 1438, 658, 550, 304, 6773, 304, 6548, 19328, 1549, 1629, 29899, 355, 869, 2398, 1919, 385, 1584, 7200, 1353, 310, 21561, 2149, 20312, 14321, 297, 7333, 17869, 322, 20493, 4066, 19257, 304, 4556, 263, 5232, 3204, 297, 1716, 21691, 805, 2548, 322, 27942, 292, 869, 319, 2846, 310, 1438, 2307, 505, 18860, 263, 11092, 417, 600, 297, 21691, 24806, 9667, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 728173800, 'load_duration': 3839700, 'prompt_eval_count': 299, 'prompt_eval_duration': 241491000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 477234000}",0.35,0.6,0.4,0.5,0.5
259,"October 23 , 1984 Consumer spending continued at a brisk pace during September and early October in the Eighth District , but home sales were down and most other sectors of the economy experienced little change . Expectations by most respondents are that consumer spending will remain strong for the remainder of the year and that manufacturing , transportation and employment will rise moderately , while construction is likely to drift lower . Consumer Spending The greatest strength in District economic activity during September and early October was in retail sales . At six department stores , sales were 8 percent higher than the comparable period a year ago , which was then considered a relatively good sales period . Better quality apparel , sports wear , cosmetics and consumer electronics moved particularly well , while sales of furniture and carpeting were below year-ago levels . At each of three discount stores , sales increases were more than 14 percent above the year-ago pace . Promotions combined with price markdowns were successful in moving merchandise . Auto demand remained strong in most parts of the District during September and early October . In the last week of September , however , sales became somewhat sluggish .

On a year-to-date basis , sales activity remains above last year 's levels throughout the region , with women 's and children 's apparel , electronics , appliances , and jewelry the best selling items . Retailers generally are projecting only moderate gains in year-end holiday sales and are consequently holding leaner inventories relative to 1984 , when holiday sales were not as strong as expected . October car sales in most areas of the region were off sharply from October 1984 and September 1985 levels .

During September , more cars were registered than in any other month in the 1980s .

The region 's multifamily residential market also remains firm amid heavy construction activity . Absorption of office building space is at very high levels in most large cities but is not keeping pace with construction activity . Vacancy rates have increased most noticeably in Tampa and Miami . High levels of shopping center and industrial construction activity are outpacing absorption in some large markets such as Atlanta and Orlando . Financial Services Business , real estate , and consumer lending by large banks accelerated at year-end 1984 and continued to grow in January . Savings and lean associations ' mortgage commitments also showed renewed strength during this period . Preliminary bank and S & L information for February suggests some slowing of consumer lending , with the business and real estate lending trends unchanged . Tourism Tourist activity improved with the weather in February , following an apparent cold weather-related slowdown in January . Moreover , the near-term outlook is quite bright , especially because business and convention travel has continued to show healthy growth .

264,"May 6 , 1985 Economic activity has slowed in the First District in recent months . The slowdown has occurred in both the manufacturing and retail sectors , but some individual firms continue to show substantial growth . Retailers ' sales fell below plan in some cases but continue to exceed last year 's levels . In manufacturing , the national slowdown in office equipment and computers has been well publicized , and New England 's high tech firms have been among those experiencing difficulty . The region 's traditional industries report mixed results , but remain optimistic about 1985 . Retail Retail sales have slowed recently in the First District . The weakening is not universal , however , hitting some `` upscale '' department stores for example , but not a discount chain , and showing wide geographic variation . The downturn is not substantial , and merchants remain moderately optimistic about 1985 . The shift of Easter from April last year to March this year complicates the interpretation of spring sales figures , but March was not an exceptional month for New England retailers . Apparel and other soft goods—traditional Easter items—sold well during the month , but sales in other areas , including home products , pets and sporting goods were disappointing . Early signs suggest that April is following the March trend , and without Easter the measured increases against April last year will be very small or negative .

265,"January 30 , 1985 The expansion appears to have resumed in the First District . Retailers experienced reasonably satisfactory year-over-year increases in Christmas sales , although promotional activity reduced margins . Retail inventories are a little higher than desired . In the manufacturing sector , recent order experience varies considerably , with some firms reporting order increases , others flat order rates and a few decreases . However , all the manufacturers contacted have projected significant real gains in 1985 . Manufacturing inventories are in line with sales , based on past experience ; but several contacts are not satisfied with this performance and are pushing to lower inventory-to-sales ratios . There is no evidence of any pickup in inflation ; recent price increases have been very modest and price expectations for 1985 seem to have moderated . Mortgage rates have been gradually falling for several months . Retailing Stores in the First District reported respectable but not spectacular sales increases over the preceding year in December and early January . Promotional activity reduced margins and inventories are somewhat above plan . Most merchants expressed optimism about sales growth in 1985 . Sales increases among the retailers contacted ranged from 6 to 10 percent above December 1983 . The recent year-over-year increases are generally smaller than those recorded earlier in 1984 , but most stores expected this because 1983 finished so strongly .

Contacts with affiliates or branches in other parts of the country said New England stores showed the best performance .

266,"July bringing new orders for the first half above last year 's first half . Builders anticipate that the second half will be equally strong . However , there is little speculative building , as builders remain cautious and uncertain about how long the current uptrend will last . Real estate firms had an exceptional second quarter . The volume of contract closings at one realty firm was the highest in two years , and its forecast for closings in the second half has been revised upward , but the firm will remain in a wait-and-see posture until August before deciding whether to increase its staff . More move-up buyers are reentering housing markets . Mortgage lending volume is picking up with the 15-year mortgage becoming popular and the adjustable rate mortgage losing favor among borrowers . In the second half of the year , mortgage markets in Ohio will receive a boost from recently approved state-subsidized mortgage money that amounts to $ 346 million and that will be available to qualifying home buyers at 9.8 percent . Commercial Banking District loan demand continues to be mixed . Loans outstanding in all major categories at large banks increased over the past month .

Consumer Spending Large retailers or general merchandise in the Twin Cities report that business has been good . Two large district chain operations had better-than-expected performance in the first quarter , which appears to have continued into April . Major retailers in bustling Sioux Falls , South Dakota , report brisk business , attributed primarily to price reductions and aggressive advertising . But Bank directors note that business has slowed in southern Minnesota and has continued to lag throughout the agriculturally dependent parts of this district . A similar story is told for auto sales which have continued strong in diversified metro areas but have been generally weak in rural areas . Domestic manufacturers report that their sales , when compared to 1984 , increased 9 percent through April . Slack demand in nonmetro areas has bogged down truck sales somewhat , though . Housing activity is also still slack in rural areas , but sales of homes in the Twin Cities have improved . Sales in both Minneapolis and St. Paul have been well above 1984 levels -- by more than 12 percent this February , for example .

Some signs of slower manufacturing growth are also evident . Employment District labor market conditions have continued to improve , regularly in the service sectors . Spurred by larger-than-usual quarterly employment growth , the district 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell a few tenths to 6.3 percent in the first quarter . Indicative of this improvement , Minnesota 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent in March , its lowest since August 1981 . Also in March , nonfarm employment reached a record high in Minnesota . Employment growth has been particularly evident in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area , which at the end of last year ranked fifth fastest in employment growth among large metro areas . Strong labor demand is present in Minneapolis , where the help-wanted advertising index was recently 11 percent above its year-earlier level . The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate also appears to have fallen in Montana , dropping from 7.6 percent in January to a probable 7 percent in March . Recent labor developments have been mixed . Layoffs at a conglomerate with plants in the Twin Cities and Sioux Falls , South Dakota , continued . As a result , the latter area 's unemployment rate rose measurably .

Retail sales gains are uneven , and less-than-robust Christmas sales are expected . Auto sales are low now that special interest rate incentives have largely ended . Industrial activity continues quite sluggish with few gains yet from dollar depreciation . Residential construction is improving but non-residential construction is uneven . Agricultural prices remain weak despite some rises in meat prices ; agricultural land prices continue to fall and farm finances remain weak . Commercial bank consumer and real estate lending is rising further but business lending is declining in most Districts . Retail Sales October retail sales other than autos are mind , with most Districts reporting moderate year-over-year gains .

Inventories are generally at desired levels and are being built cautiously as most retailers expect Christmas sales to show only moderate increases from 1984 . New car sales continue to run well below year-ago levels in most Districts in reaction to the end of most special financing . However , Richmond and Dallas report sales were stronger than usual in October . Manufacturing and Mining Industrial activity continues to be quite sluggish .

Residential sales are strong in most areas , spurred by stable mortgage rates at just over 12 percent , rising incomes , and the availability of subsidized mortgage money in some states . House prices are reported to be firm and new listings strong . Nonresidential construction is generally weaker than residential building , but still healthy in many regions . There is some evidence that new construction may be slowing slightly , but projects already underway should provide continued strength . Many observers are surprised that nonresidential construction has not already lost steam , in view of rising vacancy rates and a general feeling that the office market is already overbuilt . Chicago notes that some projects have been started recently so that they will be grandfathered under the current tax code and thereby protected from future tax changes . Office leasing activity is mixed , with vacancy rates at suburban locations generally higher than in downtown areas . As a result , rents in suburban areas may hold steady or even fall in coming months . Agriculture While livestock farmers have gotten some measure of relief recently from higher livestock prices , crop farmers remain in financial stress in many areas , and may find their plight worsening . Harvests currently underway are likely to yield bumper crops that will drive farm prices and revenues even lower .

This is indicated in key words and phrases in district summaries : Boston , `` retail sales improving , manufacturing in the doldrums '' ; New York , `` little growth '' ; Philadelphia , `` same as August '' ; Cleveland , `` soft and uneven '' ; Richmond , no `` broadbased improvement '' ; Atlanta , `` healthy on balance '' ; Chicago , `` no overall pickup or weakening '' ; St. Louis , `` continues to lag '' ; Minneapolis , `` a bit weaker '' ; Kansas City and Dallas , `` sluggish '' ; and San Francisco , '' signals are mixed '' . Among economic sectors , however , there are significant variations . Perhaps the most troubled sector , at present , is agriculture , with prices and income severely depressed . Total employment is growing moderately , but with great variation by region . Manufacturing output , overall , is about stable . Mining , including oil and gas development , is depressed . Retail sales are somewhat stronger , but mainly disappointing . Auto sales have been stimulated by special financing . Inventories are in fairly good balance , and all types of goods readily available .

Retail sales seem to be running well ahead of national trends , with experience varying significantly across product lines and regions . District employment has drawn recent support from construction , government , and to a lesser extent from manufacturing , sufficient to offset seasonal losses in agriculture related areas and tourism services . Manufacturing Manufacturing activity in the District , after leveling out in the past few months , is showing some signs of trying to bounce off of the bottom reached last summer . Several District states have experienced manufacturing employment gains lately , and even where employment shows continued weakness , average weekly hours of production workers has tuned up sharply . The modest gains achieved in the textile , apparel , and furniture industries a month ago are being held , and in some cases even built upon .

Some pickup in textile and apparel exports has developed of late providing some support for these industries , while in the furniture group , strong retail sales are beginning to",0.6,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:29:16.7447896Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.6\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 6185, 1096, 29871, 29945, 1919, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29947, 29945, 6811, 1493, 4546, 271, 13676, 515, 2820, 278, 29008, 386, 7457, 4368, 393, 17407, 322, 5381, 6354, 9242, 3755, 4549, 869, 24791, 284, 13879, 526, 10805, 777, 521, 595, 292, 310, 5703, 358, 6354, 1919, 322, 4266, 13879, 1568, 408, 278, 1095, 310, 278, 3345, 5249, 11782, 3277, 28602, 1907, 310, 5683, 11801, 322, 4688, 6416, 526, 884, 10805, 777, 14679, 869, 10050, 621, 6393, 1919, 5703, 358, 1919, 3240, 737, 16538, 1919, 7632, 1919, 322, 27261, 16538, 526, 599, 8967, 1919, 373, 17346, 1919, 304, 367, 13587, 472, 3755, 1880, 11174, 869, 4649, 737, 16538, 2833, 304, 367, 2734, 1532, 14432, 310, 4797, 534, 1975, 1919, 411, 7271, 24099, 16951, 4822, 3234, 3454, 322, 12786, 869, 7457, 5703, 358, 756, 12061, 7786, 2304, 515, 7632, 1919, 5874, 1919, 322, 304, 263, 3109, 261, 15834, 515, 12012, 3864, 1919, 8002, 304, 9210, 4259, 284, 28495, 297, 18032, 545, 4475, 10161, 322, 6282, 1608, 5786, 869, 2315, 9765, 3864, 2315, 9765, 3864, 6354, 297, 278, 7457, 1919, 1156, 3233, 292, 714, 297, 278, 4940, 2846, 7378, 1919, 338, 6445, 777, 18906, 310, 1811, 304, 289, 21543, 1283, 310, 278, 5970, 7450, 1833, 11801, 869, 21882, 7457, 5922, 505, 18860, 12012, 3864, 5703, 358, 330, 2708, 301, 2486, 1919, 322, 1584, 988, 5703, 358, 3697, 7572, 8062, 2264, 1919, 6588, 4723, 368, 6199, 310, 5802, 17162, 756, 18515, 287, 701, 15301, 368, 869, 450, 878, 342, 330, 2708, 14363, 297, 278, 1426, 488, 1919, 623, 17243, 1919, 322, 15252, 17252, 6397, 2722, 263, 4098, 8020, 526, 1641, 4934, 1919, 322, 297, 777, 4251, 1584, 4240, 2501, 869, 13, 13, 9526, 5839, 786, 297, 1426, 488, 322, 623, 17243, 29586, 756, 8906, 310, 5683, 13138, 777, 2304, 363, 1438, 6397, 2722, 1919, 1550, 297, 278, 15252, 17252, 2318, 1919, 4549, 3240, 737, 16538, 526, 6763, 304, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 29871, 29900, 29889, 29953, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 850574300, 'load_duration': 6160200, 'prompt_eval_count': 364, 'prompt_eval_duration': 330162000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 508705000}",0.85,0.7,0.6,0.95,0.8

On balance , activity seems flat to rising slightly . Some of the areas of earlier strength continue to lend support , while others , notably the retail sector , have softened markedly . Construction activity and house sales remain upbeat . Manufacturing is flat to down slightly , although there is some indication that the slide in manufacturing employment has been arrested . Coal production remains below year earlier , although stocks have been drawn down significantly since year-end . The service sector remains the primary source of employment growth . The outlook fur agriculture has improved somewhat of late because of much improved weather conditions . Manufacturing There is little evidence of any significant turnaround in the manufacturing sector despite a modestly improved employment situation . According to our reports , manufacturing shipments stabilized over the past month , although new orders and order backlogs both declined . Month to month changes continue to be dominated by such sectors as textiles , apparel , and furniture where imports continue to gain market share . Some of this weakness has been offset recently by very modest gains in primary and fabricated metals , food products , and segments of the chemicals industry .

Coal production continues to run slightly below year ago levels , but recent employment losses appear to have been stemmed in this industry as well .

However , pressure on costs is sufficiently severe that production increases do not result necessarily in more jobs . Mining sectors remain weak , with low prices and reduced employment in petroleum . With the exception of major gold mining and refining operations which have realized recent strength , there is no sign of improvement in the beleaguered mineral mining sector . Construction and Real Estate In general , building has been strong , although high vacancy rates in commercial and residential property in most parts of the district portend reduced construction activity in the future . While building permits remain strong in Phoenix , for example , many issued permits are not being used . Much of the residential building is focused on multifamily dwellings . In some markets , signals are mixed . For example , in Idaho , May residential permits were 28 percent below May 1984 , but the value of commercial construction was 45 percent above May 1984 .

Even so , existing damage to major crops suggests that revenue of farmers in Alabama , Georgia , and Tennessee will fall far short of production costs . In addition to severe crop losses from the summer drought , the Southeast is experiencing substantial damage to its timber industry . In Georgia and Alabama total forestry losses may exceed $ 30 million . At mid-year , the Federal Land Bank of Jackson , Mississippi , was one of four in the nation requiring a transfer of funds from the eight other FLB 's to maintain solvency . The severe drought in the Southeast will likely increase losses to the Farm Credit System during the remainder of 1986 . In response , the FCS has increased reserves for losses and instituted a number of belt-tightening measures , including office mergers and consolidations and reductions in personnel .",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:29:19.0632754Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": -0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 29894, 562, 362, 414, 526, 528, 24377, 1009, 15422, 800, 304, 10161, 393, 505, 451, 18860, 27550, 1855, 10194, 1316, 408, 7400, 1919, 12568, 1919, 564, 333, 278, 1704, 747, 14471, 869, 9267, 526, 884, 23906, 3122, 17700, 322, 26901, 713, 14354, 869, 12074, 1919, 363, 278, 18372, 386, 7457, 1919, 278, 1857, 534, 355, 9432, 29879, 263, 29871, 29896, 29900, 304, 29871, 29896, 29889, 29906, 10151, 11581, 297, 6282, 391, 7977, 975, 1833, 1629, 869, 27051, 545, 3599, 296, 17251, 338, 19912, 4940, 1973, 736, 304, 4226, 297, 4192, 1774, 29899, 710, 21475, 10161, 322, 1122, 5557, 4340, 274, 1336, 28495, 1919, 7148, 363, 577, 29891, 11700, 322, 20118, 880, 869, 7753, 577, 1919, 5923, 18658, 304, 4655, 8182, 567, 14661, 393, 337, 9947, 310, 2215, 13269, 297, 26911, 1919, 16762, 1919, 322, 22664, 674, 6416, 2215, 3273, 310, 5802, 21544, 869, 512, 6124, 304, 22261, 274, 1336, 28495, 515, 278, 11801, 4192, 1774, 1919, 278, 317, 449, 15879, 338, 10623, 3277, 23228, 18658, 304, 967, 5335, 495, 13661, 869, 512, 16762, 322, 26911, 3001, 13569, 719, 28495, 1122, 13461, 395, 29871, 29941, 29900, 7284, 869, 2180, 7145, 29899, 6360, 1919, 278, 14879, 3172, 10253, 310, 11886, 1919, 24743, 1919, 471, 697, 310, 3023, 297, 278, 5233, 26795, 263, 6782, 310, 29199, 515, 278, 9475, 916, 383, 29931, 29933, 525, 29879, 304, 7344, 899, 854, 1270, 869, 450, 22261, 4192, 1774, 297, 278, 317, 449, 15879, 674, 5517, 7910, 28495, 304, 278, 23354, 24596, 277, 2184, 2645, 278, 21162, 310, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29947, 29953, 869, 512, 2933, 1919, 278, 7992, 29903, 756, 11664, 620, 20098, 363, 28495, 322, 25444, 3860, 263, 1353, 310, 1339, 29873, 29899, 29873, 523, 8333, 15366, 1919, 3704, 8034, 2778, 5743, 322, 1136, 17211, 800, 322, 3724, 1953, 297, 24127, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29908, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 798062100, 'load_duration': 6037300, 'prompt_eval_count': 348, 'prompt_eval_duration': 318825000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 470479000}",0.45,0.4,-0.4,0.5,0.3

A number of merchants reported difficulty in keeping stores and home offices fully staffed . Turnover is rising ( `` because it is so easy for employees to find new jobs '' ) and it is difficult to hire new employees , especially at the lower-paid end of the market . Forecasts for the remainder of the year are closely tied to recent performance . For stores performing poorly , this represents a more negative outlook compared with earlier this year . Apparel Prices Because of the sizable apparel price increase in the CPI , inquiries about the sources of this increase were made among First District retailers . These retailers report that apparel import prices are rising substantially ( 10-25 percent compared to a year earlier ) ; they lay the blame for these increases on both the quota system and the decline in the value of the dollar . Prices of domestically produced apparel are increasing more gradually ; these domestic price increases are attributed to rising textile prices . Strong demand for apparel is leading to increases in the prices at which quotas are bought and sold among overseas manufacturers . Also , because the quotas limit the quantity ( not value ) of goods that foreign producers can send to the United States , the items now imported include fewer inexpensive goods .

One Arizona electronics manufacturer exports about 30 percent of its product to Japan . U.S. companies that have shifted manufacturing activities to Japan also expressed concern about the potential impact of more stringent tariffs . At the same time , some argue that the escalating trade friction has opened up Japanese markets to U.S. firms . In addition , both Taiwan and South Korea , fearing possible retaliatory actions against them , have taken significant steps to reduce tariffs and duties on a large number of items . Moreover , Japanese firms can be expected to continue shifting more production to the U.S. , with California a prime candidate for that investment . Finally , if allegations about semiconductor `` dumping '' are true , and if U.S. trade measures curtail dumping , western electronics firms should benefit . Agriculture and Resource Related Industries Prices for cattle and sheep have increased and reportedly are reaching profitable levels . However , ranchers remain cautious because higher prices tend to attract foreign imports in both markets . Prices of apples , potatoes and milk also have risen .

Some express concern about funding this growth in assets ; while most contacts are satisfied with deposit growth at this time , several expect they will have to increase interest rates on deposits soon in order to attract retail funds to match growing loan demand .",-0.25,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:29:39.5797645Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.25\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 7045, 13587, 27357, 363, 278, 4940, 1023, 470, 2211, 439, 13868, 869, 450, 27725, 310, 14321, 297, 1855, 19989, 301, 2548, 1919, 1550, 1603, 9045, 29891, 1919, 18172, 304, 260, 7202, 1283, 869, 10253, 414, 4443, 263, 23806, 297, 24806, 7274, 515, 18777, 17785, 297, 1580, 28524, 9279, 869, 18008, 7457, 9124, 414, 2149, 24806, 9667, 304, 6773, 304, 6548, 472, 2820, 967, 1857, 27725, 472, 3203, 1549, 278, 1095, 310, 278, 1629, 869, 3834, 4653, 5932, 1048, 5220, 292, 445, 14321, 297, 21608, 2056, 1550, 1556, 25957, 526, 15787, 411, 19754, 277, 14321, 472, 445, 931, 1919, 3196, 2149, 896, 674, 505, 304, 7910, 4066, 19257, 373, 19754, 1169, 4720, 297, 1797, 304, 13978, 3240, 737, 29199, 304, 1993, 15678, 24806, 9667, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29906, 29945, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 665780600, 'load_duration': 3476700, 'prompt_eval_count': 175, 'prompt_eval_duration': 138004000, 'eval_count': 16, 'eval_duration': 518616000}",0.3,0.4,0.2,0.5,0.3

308,"May 3 , 1989 Summary Contacts in the Seventh District indicate that economic expansion is continuing but is less rapid than earlier . Payroll employment through February continued to trend upward in the District states about in line with the nation . Unemployment in the region averaged 5.3 percent of the labor force in February , down nearly to the national average of 5.1 percent after being higher since 1979 . However , in March unemployment rose in Illinois and Michigan in contrast with the further national decline . Hiring plans are strong in the Midwest . Chicago purchasing managers surveyed in March indicated that expansion of production , orders , and backlogs continued but was less widespread than last year . This less heated expansion was reflected in prices paid , which showed widespread increases but less so than earlier . Milwaukee purchasers ' reports have shown a similar trend over the past year . Higher petroleum prices are boosting costs for industry , transportation , and consumers . Contacts with industrial firms in the District have noted slower increases in orders or shipments for some types of machinery , paperboard , electronics , and rail transport .

309,"September 20 , 1989 Summary Retailers appear more optimistic about sales prospects for the balance of this year , although sales patterns have been mixed . Manufacturing activity remains at high levels , but softening is apparent even in some capital goods industries . Steel operations have been reduced largely because of inventory liquidation . Commercial and industrial loans continue to soften . Money market rates are expected to ease over the next few months , and the thrift bailout has resulted in lower rates on CDs issued by thrifts . Retail Sales Department store retailers have become more optimistic about fall and holiday-season sales prospects apparently because of better- than-expected sales so far this summer . Apparel sales in particular revived from the slump in 1988 , and profits and profit margins improved last quarter without more than usual sales promotions . Retailers plan to hold larger inventories than they did late last year . A chain department store , however , believes that retailers are too optimistic and that inventories will become a growing problem over the next few months . Another major chain retailer reports a spurt in July and August sales of household furnishings and home improvement products , but large inventories will require cutbacks in orders from some manufacturers . This retailer also expects a better fall and Christmas sales season this year than last .

It has been attempting to hold the line on prices for imported goods by shifting sources of supply , and , in the case of",0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:29:42.6570002Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": 0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 2008, 3266, 29871, 29906, 29900, 1919, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29947, 29929, 6991, 5219, 4649, 737, 414, 2615, 901, 5994, 4695, 1048, 16538, 27289, 29879, 363, 278, 17346, 310, 445, 1629, 1919, 5998, 16538, 15038, 505, 1063, 12849, 869, 2315, 9765, 3864, 6354, 9242, 472, 1880, 11174, 1919, 541, 4964, 8333, 338, 20295, 1584, 297, 777, 7483, 22535, 6397, 2722, 869, 2443, 295, 6931, 505, 1063, 12212, 18425, 1363, 310, 11817, 706, 23904, 362, 869, 422, 1050, 1455, 322, 18408, 658, 550, 6773, 304, 4964, 264, 869, 341, 4992, 9999, 19257, 526, 3806, 304, 16326, 975, 278, 2446, 2846, 7378, 1919, 322, 278, 1468, 2027, 289, 737, 449, 756, 20601, 297, 5224, 19257, 373, 7307, 29879, 16610, 491, 1468, 17741, 869, 4649, 737, 28389, 10317, 3787, 3240, 737, 414, 505, 4953, 901, 5994, 4695, 1048, 6416, 322, 8753, 22394, 29899, 25682, 16538, 27289, 29879, 13229, 1363, 310, 2253, 29899, 1135, 29899, 9684, 16538, 577, 2215, 445, 11801, 869, 2401, 17243, 16538, 297, 3153, 6664, 2347, 515, 278, 2243, 3427, 297, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29947, 29947, 1919, 322, 2600, 1169, 322, 21665, 15276, 1144, 16710, 1833, 12616, 1728, 901, 1135, 9670, 16538, 2504, 327, 1080, 869, 4649, 737, 414, 3814, 304, 4808, 7200, 11817, 3842, 1135, 896, 1258, 5683, 1833, 1629, 869, 319, 9704, 14311, 3787, 1919, 3138, 1919, 1339, 17180, 393, 3240, 737, 414, 526, 2086, 5994, 4695, 322, 393, 11817, 3842, 674, 4953, 263, 15678, 1108, 975, 278, 2446, 2846, 7378, 869, 7280, 4655, 9704, 3240, 737, 261, 13676, 263, 805, 4227, 297, 5468, 322, 3111, 16538, 310, 22329, 15252, 728, 886, 322, 3271, 20414, 9316, 1919, 541, 2919, 11817, 3842, 674, 1996, 5700, 1627, 29879, 297, 11299, 515, 777, 12012, 332, 414, 869, 910, 3240, 737, 261, 884, 23347, 263, 2253, 6416, 322, 17661, 16538, 4259, 445, 1629, 1135, 1833, 869, 13, 13, 3112, 756, 1063, 15661, 304, 4808, 278, 1196, 373, 26094, 363, 19673, 22535, 491, 528, 24377, 8974, 310, 11421, 1919, 322, 1919, 297, 278, 1206, 310, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29908, 18616, 2073, 1115, 29871, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 797816700, 'load_duration': 6015400, 'prompt_eval_count': 381, 'prompt_eval_duration': 336224000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 455514000}",0.6,0.6,0.2,0.75,0.6
310,"May 3 , 1989 The economy shows some mixed signs of slowing , led by consumer spending and residential construction . The worst of the surge in food and energy prices is probably over , assuming improved supplies . Higher interest rates are generally not considered to have had much effect on housing and other construction , or on capital goods industries . Thrifts continue to experience deposit outflows , although the April outflow apparently was not as severe as in previous months this year . Consumer Spending Several retailers report sales were better-than-expected over the past 6 weeks , and better than what has been reported in national data . Some retailers expect sales to soften this quarter , especially because of higher gasoline prices . An upscale retailer , however , noted a double-digit increase in spending last quarter and believes his upper-income customers are not much affected by a rise in interest rates . The automotive industry apparently is successfully offsetting higher interest rates by offering special financing rates and cash rebates that are the broadest and , in some cases , the most generous yet offered . Incentives are not as broad for foreign cars . Auto dealers report strengthening sales in early April . They generally are guardedly optimistic over spring and summer sales but are more cautious than dealers surveyed in early March .

One large retailer reports that February sales were up 11 percent from a year ago ; and same-store sales , a measure of sales in stores open a year or more , were up 4.7 percent from February 1988 . Another retailer reports that February sales were lower than expected with an 8.5 percent increase in sales over a year ago . Businesses in St . Cloud , Minnesota are very optimistic with approximately $ 40 million in bids for new construction expected to be made in the next two weeks . Much of this construction is for schools , which is considered a good sign of population growth . Inventories are at generally acceptable levels throughout the district . Motor vehicles have been selling well . Dealers for one domestic manufacturer report that sales in the first twenty days of February were down 6 percent from the comparable period in January , but were up 10 percent over the same period in February 1988 . Sales were good in January for this manufacturer with car sales up 14 percent and truck sales up 15 percent from January 1988 .

323,"but they anticipate some slackening in the expansion of commercial and industrial lending in the second half of the year . Manufacturing Activity in the Third District industrial sector appears to be easing to a steady pace . Just over half of the manufacturers contacted in late March and early April reported that business was stable , and the number noting improvement barely exceeded the number indicating that their business was slowing . Reports of improvement were common among nondurable goods producers while most makers of durables said business has been flat in recent weeks . Overall , executives at area industrial firms generally noted modest increases in new orders and a fractional rise in shipments but no change in order backlogs during March . On balance , area firms are permitting inventories to run down for the fourth month in a row . Employment is holding up as area manufacturing firms added marginally to payrolls during March . Industrial prices in the region continue to rise . Nearly half of the manufacturers contacted in April said input costs moved up from a month earlier and one-quarter raised the prices of the products they make . The increases do not appear to be accelerating , however , as reports of higher prices are not quite as widespread now as they were over the winter .

324,"the survey participants responding in early March said their business was moving up from last month while 12 percent reported slower operations . Specific measures of industrial activity reflect this fractional growth . Area firms are booking more new orders than they did last month and they are stepping up shipments enough to work down order backlogs a bit . Inventories are level with last month . Employment shows only a little improvement as both payrolls and working hours are moving up just marginally . Survey respondents continue to report rising prices , although such indications do not appear to be as widespread this month as they have been for the past year . Nearly one-half of the firms polled for the March survey are paying higher prices for purchased goods compared to a month ago and one-quarter are charging more for their own products . Local manufacturers forecast only steady activity for the next six months , an improvement from the January and February surveys in which expectations of a downturn prevailed . The balance of responses to the most recent poll indicates that managers at area plants expect the rate of both new orders and shipments to be fairly flat for the next two quarters , and they anticipate a further decline in order backlogs . In accordance with these expectations , local firms ' employment plans call for steady payrolls and some shortening of the workweek between now and September .

No new office construction of any magnitude is expected in the downtown area for several years . Although slight gains were reported this summer , District residential construction growth remains sluggish . The value of District residential contracts issued in the first seven months of 1989 is virtually identical to that of a year earlier , with building of multi-family dwellings particularly weak . Agriculture Most District crops are in fair-to-good condition . Drier conditions in southern states have helped improve cotton and soybean crops that were damaged by excess rain earlier in the season . Continued rains in northern Missouri have helped drought-stressed late soybeans and pastures , but arrived too late to help the corn and sorghum crops . Agricultural banks servicing weather-stressed areas are not anticipating a substantial change in the quality of their agricultural loan portfolios this year . Banking District bank earnings declined 4.6 percent in the second quarter . Loan losses in the commercial area and additions to loan loss reserves hampered earnings . Asset quality declined during the second quarter , particularly at the largest banks where nonperforming loans represent 2.16 percent of total loans .

Recent behavior in retail sales and reports from retailers in several Districts indicate that sales have been slow in recent months , and are expected to remain so in the short term . It is unclear how much of the recent softness in retail sales represents temporary factors , such as unusual weather over the last several months . Both residential and nonresidential construction have been edging downward in recent months in most Districts , and indicators of future construction suggest further softening . Prospects for a good harvest this year should be improved as a result of ample rainfall in previously drought-stricken regions of the country , but cool , wet weather has delayed planting by as much as several weeks . The slow-growth economy is accompanied by an easing in demand for credit . Real estate loans , consumer loans , and business loans are still growing , but at reduced rates in recent months . Lenders are reported to have tightened standards especially for real estate loans , but there is still little information that suggests credit restraint is spreading into other markets .

Bankers contacted in early January said a slowdown in the rate of growth was continuing . Most expect overall loan demand to move up only modestly as the national economy enters at least one or two quarters of slower growth . As the new year began , commercial and industrial lending was being scaled back at several large banks in the district as conditions in some sectors prompted credit reviews of companies in those industries .

339,". Manufacturing Our regular mail survey suggested that District manufacturing activity declined slightly in early November . Respondents indicated that shipments , orders , and employment declined , but that inventories of raw materials and finished goods changed little . Most manufacturers felt that poor sales were their biggest problem , and manufacturers of furniture , textiles and apparel said their industries were definitely in recessions . Some manufacturers said that customers were increasingly reluctant to order very far ahead . Raw materials prices rose , but most manufacturers apparently held finished product prices steady . Even firms that use petroleum-based inputs like chemicals and plastics said that they had absorbed sharp increases in their raw material costs and had not increased prices of their finished goods . Manufacturers saw weakness in current economic conditions , but they were somewhat less pessimistic than a month ago about prospects for business next year . Most respondents believed that economic activity weakened in their local areas and in the nation in early November , and about half expected further weakening in the months ahead . A significantly larger number of respondents in November than in October , however , expected activity to pick up in coming months .

Port Activity Officials at District ports—Baltimore , Charleston , and Hampton Roads ( Norfolk ) —indicated that , seasonally adjusted , exports rose in October from September and imports were generally unchanged .

344,"for additional inventory accumulation . Financial Services According to most banking contacts , loan demand increased only slightly in the past month and remains below year-ago levels . They complain that it is difficult to obtain high quality loan applications . Much of the reported increase in demand was attributed to market share gains by the reporting banks as borrowers moved from troubled or merged institutions . On the other hand , one banker said that his institution may have tightened credit standards too much and was losing market share as a result . Auto dealers and construction contractors continue to report that credit is difficult to obtain . Construction Most realtor contacts had seen home sales levelling in their typical seasonal pattern in October and early November . Homes in the lower price range continued to report the most sales activity as lower mortgage interest rates stimulated first-time home buyers . Sales of higher priced homes remained sluggish , forcing sellers to reduce prices . Some contacts noted a strengthening in multifamily leasing and rental rates ; however , they saw little new construction of multifamily residences . Meanwhile , several contacts report small gains in the activity of surviving home builders in the past several months . The commercial real estate market has shown little change in this reporting period .

Commercial office space remains overbuilt in many cities , with effective rental rates depressed , and little or no improvement in absorption .

Durable goods sales showed above-average gains , led by appliances and home improvement products . The late Labor Day holiday was often cited as a factor constraining August sales comparisons . However , a large retailer and a bank each noted that a renewed wave of mortgage refinancing also played a role , because upfront fees postponed improvement in borrower cash flow . Renewed declines in mortgage interest rates have been accompanied by scattered signs of strengthening in housing activity , although the increase does not appear to be as robust as in the first quarter .

Banking Lending by District banks continued to improve , with gains concentrated in residential mortgage lending . Many contacts noted that recent declines in mortgage rates have again stimulated refinancing activity , although new mortgage lending also rose in recent weeks . Reports on commercial and industrial lending activity were mixed . A middle-market lender reported that credit line utilization in June and early July remained relatively flat , and stated that capital spending among its customers had been insensitive to interest rate changes . Another middle-market lender reported that borrower demand softened again in recent weeks . Several law firms involved in loan contract negotiations reported increasingly aggressive lending postures among banks , but a pickup in borrower demand remained relatively sluggish .

Some producers expect higher outlays this year , particularly for equipment , to improve product quality , broaden product lines , and increase productivity . Some plan less spending this year than last because of cutbacks in business structures . A tool producer plans a step-up in spending this year for further modernization of existing facilities . Although the primary metals industry is apparently anticipating some cutback in spending this year , a producer plans a large capital expenditure for quality and cost improvement . A mineral resources producer expects his firm and industry to cut back spending in 1992 because of prospects for weak prices for their products . Capital spending plans are not being delayed , although some may be stretched out , and discussion of a possible tax change is not yet affecting spending plans . A common view among manufacturers seems to be that an investment tax credit , although less beneficial over the long run than a cut in corporate tax rates , would be a temporary stimulus to investment .

Consumer Spending Second District department stores reported that sales growth was slightly stronger in April than in May . Although the range of year- to-year sales growth was quite similar for both months -- flat to +15 percent in April as compared to -3 percent to +15 percent in May -- more stores were clustered near the bottom of the range during the most recent period . Easter boosted sales of children 's clothing in April , while unusually cool weather slowed apparel sales the following month . All contacts reported inventories on plan . Fifteen New York metropolitan area department stores are scheduled to close by summer 's end , resulting in the loss of 7,200 jobs . Several of the stores are the last remaining retail anchors in older downtown areas ; the Fordham Road section of the Bronx and downtown Newark and New Rochelle are expected to be particularly hard hit . On a more positive note , a major New Jersey shopping mall has announced plans for expansion and renovation , including three new luxury department stores to replace two anchors which had previously closed .

380,"June 23 , 1993 Summary Economic expansion in the District continued in May and early June . Reports from retailers and consumer goods manufacturers suggest that retail sales growth picked up modestly , aided in part by pent-up demand after unseasonably bad weather in the first quarter . Manufacturing activity continued its expansion , with slowing growth in some sectors offset by improving results in several industries that had previously been weak . Motor vehicle production continued to gain momentum , with output plans for the third quarter calling for a significant increase over year-earlier levels . Survey-based measures and reports from individual businesses gave no evidence of significant upward pressure on prices . Retail Sales Reports from large retailers and manufacturers of consumer goods suggest that consumer demand increased in the District in recent months . A large department store chain reported that sales growth in the Midwest increased moderately ( on a seasonally adjusted basis ) in May and early June , after a snapback in April from weather-depressed levels in the first quarter . Sales strength remained concentrated in durable goods , notably appliances and home improvement items . Credit utilization continued to rise and delinquency rates continued to improve . A large discount chain reported improvement in traffic and increased sales momentum during May and early June .

This firm expected same-store sales growth to improve modestly in the latter half of 1993 .

A manufacturer of heavy equipment experiencing renewed strength in most of its business lines cited the lack of a generalized upturn in demand for commodities as the most important factor leading sales of mining equipment to lag the companywide average .

'' Agriculture The pace in crop plantings improved considerably in recent weeks , overcoming most of the earlier delays from cool , wet weather . The delays may result in some modest shifting in the mix of crop acres . However , analysts believe that virtually all of the intended corn acreage in District states was seeded prior to the passing of critical planting dates . ( June 15 is generally regarded as the latest acceptable date for planting corn . ) Early crop development -- both for field crops and for much of the District 's vegetable acreage -- is below normal due to the late plantings .

Regarding the outlook for the holiday season , all respondents spoke of strong gains last year and the likelihood of much smaller year-to-year increases this Christmas . Citing consumer concern about continuing employment cutbacks and a consequent unwillingness to spend freely , most District retailers are planning for increases of 3 to 5 percent over last year 's holiday sales , with one respondent noting that no change over last year was a definite possibility . Residential Construction and Real Estate District homebuilding activity showed little change in recent weeks , though a slight pickup in traffic and contracts was reported in some areas .

While retail sales results varied widely during April and May , a majority of contacts reported sales were under plan . Homebuilding activity slowed somewhat in parts of the District and the earlier optimism about surpassing last year 's level of starts was less pervasive . Office leasing activity picked up in recent weeks , however , and primary vacancy rates declined in much of the District . New Jersey 's unemployment rate fell sharply in May while New York 's rate rose . Recent discussions with 26 manufacturing firms indicated a modest increase in sales is anticipated over the next six months . Small and midsized banks in the District reported no change in their willingness to lend .

They attributed this in part to cool and rainy weather during much of the period and also to a continued cautiousness on the part of consumers due to economic uncertainty . Some retailers noted a pickup in sales towards the end of May and into early June , however . Over-the-year sales changes ranged from -4 percent to +10 percent in April and from -5 percent to +2.5 percent in May .

Hotel occupancies are down from a year ago in southern and central Florida ; officials blame this sluggishness on competition from other tourist destinations and adverse publicity about crime . Continuing growth in the Asian and Latin American markets , however , appears to be offsetting some of the reported slowdown in visitors from Europe , and cruise industry bookings remain strong year over year .

Retail Winter storms and cold temperatures took a considerable bite out of retail sales in the First District . Sales in January and early February were either flat or down , in some cases as much as 15 percent , compared to year-earlier levels . Apparel stores were particularly hard hit ; fewer shoppers took advantage of January promotions , leaving retailers with excess inventories of seasonal clothing . Contacts reported no significant rebound in sales after storms . The fortunate retailers were those with stocks of winter survival items , such as salt , dry gas , shovels , and cold medicine . Despite the short-term setback , retailers seem more optimistic about this year than last , anticipating 2 to 10 percent growth in sales . Many expect to see gross margins and profits increase as a result of fewer markdowns , better management of inventories , and continued cost controls .

398,"May 4 , 1994 Summary Seventh District economic conditions continued to improve in March and April , with retail sales boosted by substantially greater improvement in the weather than the norm for this time of year . Aside from the weather effects , the underlying upward momentum in consumption and housing activity may have slowed somewhat from the unusually rapid fourth quarter pace . Reports from manufacturers generally remained quite upbeat , although a number of manufacturing contacts expressed greater uncertainty about the pace of activity in their markets in the latter half of 1994 , citing the effects of increases in interest rates . Reports of price increases remained concentrated in building materials and metals industries . Early planting and weaker export prospects are currently weighing on crop prices , but District farmland values continued to appreciate in early 1994 . Retail Sales and Housing Consumer spending and housing activity continued to expand in the District in recent months , aided by substantial improvement in the weather following unusually harsh conditions earlier in the year . A large general merchandise retailer stated that underlying sales momentum remained positive through early April , with sales of home furnishings and other housing-related items still leading overall sales growth .

399,"holiday season . This contact stated that weather disruptions were isolated to a few days , with only a marginal impact on overall sales . A survey of a large number of smaller retailers in Illinois and Indiana continued to show an improving trend in recent months . Home sales and construction activity surged in the region as 1993 came to a close , with little sign of a slowdown in the underlying momentum thus far in 1994 . Some realty and banking contacts attributed at least part of the increased activity to home buyers ' beliefs that mortgage interest rates may have stopped declining , leading sonic to conclude that the recent burst in activity could prove short-lived . Still , reports from local realtor boards in the region remained quite optimistic , with most noting that sales closings rose faster in January and February than in late 1993 . At the same time , the bad weather postponed home showings , which could be followed by slower growth in closings in March and April . One of the largest realtors in the District reported that transactions in January rose over 30 percent from year-earlier levels , partly due to special factors , but results were still a good deal better than expected . Employment Seventh District labor markets also continued to strengthen in late 1993 and early 1994 .

400,"January and February 1993 , but retailers appear optimistic about recent sales gains and their implications for longer-term consumer demand . However , all of the respondents did speak of increasingly competitive market conditions and thinning profit margins . Housing and Construction The extremely strong performance of the housing sector in the last part of 1993 is not seen as sustainable . There is a sense that some of last year 's activity was driven by a belief that interest rates had reached their trough , triggering some amount of speculative buying . Nonetheless , 1994 is expected to be solid , reflecting strong underlying demand due to demographic factors , moderating long-term interest rates , and slight increases in income and employment . Housing markets in the Fourth District have been strong for some time , and more of the same is expected for 1994 . Lending Activity Consumers are said to `` look healthy '' : Delinquency rates are low and indexes of borrowing by existing customers are their strongest in more than two years . Commercial loans , which were down at the end of 1993 , picked up somewhat at the beginning of the year . The rise in interest rates has cooled mortgage refinancings , and slower growth in consumer loans is expected to ensue as a result of mortgage borrowing having reached its peak .

408,"a Ninth District survey of agricultural credit conditions at the end of fourth quarter 1993 . Agricultural interest rates were unchanged to slightly down . Consumer spending and tourism '' Retail trade is strong . '' reported an advisory council member from eastern North Dakota whose views are echoed by his colleagues , directors and other sources across the Ninth District . He noted that retail sales were slow on extremely cold days but rebounded when weather moderated . The owner of a Wisconsin chain of auto repair and accessory shops reported record sales in January . A consumer confidence poll conducted in Minnesota in early February showed the highest level since December 1989 . The increase was largely attributed to statements of increased willingness to spend on appliances and other major items . Vehicle sales continue above year- earlier levels in all states . Winter tourism was strengthening in late February after somewhat slower business in late January and early February . Skiing in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was down slightly for January and February due to cold weather , but out-of-state snowmobilers kept their vacation plans in northern Wisconsin .

411,"said sales for the months of January and February were adversely affected by winter storms and persistent difficult driving conditions that forced store closings and hampered shoppers getting to stores when they were open . Many merchants estimated that their sales for January were off as much as 20 percent from the sane month a year ago and that sales were down in February also . Auto dealers reported similar results . As a result of the falloff in sales , store executives said inventories were above desired levels , although most merchants said the overstocking was not extreme . Third District merchants are generally optimistic that sales will pick up for all lines of merchandise as spring approaches . Several said they believe a trend to higher levels of purchasing by consumers is underway and that retail sales will move up when extreme winter weather abates . Auto dealers also believe the basic sales trend is upward . Finance Third District bankers reported in February that loan volumes outstanding had declined from the beginning of the year , which they attributed mainly to seasonal factors .

But most manufacturers also note selected areas of market weakness , and the region 's retailers report disappointing results . While commodity prices continue to rise , some contacts report signs of deceleration ; sales prices remain stable at most firms .

Poor sellers were apparel , particularly winter clothing , snow- removal equipment , housewares , sports equipment , and ready-to- assemble furniture . Home office and electronics continued to perform well . Reports on price increases varied considerably . A few retailers cited an overall rise of 2 to 3 percent in vendor prices , and increases of over 10 percent on leather , plastic , and paper products . By contrast , prices on apparel have dropped modestly , and food prices remain level with the exception of meat , the price of which has reportedly declined over 10 percent in the past year .

Retail sales improved and manufacturers continued to operate at high levels of capacity . While single-family homebuilding slowed further , multifamily construction picked up in some parts of the district The district 's winter wheat crop was generally in good condition , and recent gains in crop and livestock prices have brightened the outlook for district farm incomes . While materials prices for manufacturers continued to rise throughout the region , upward pressure on wages was less prevalent . Retailers held prices steady despite increases in costs of goods and labor . Retail Sales Retailers report that sales improved over the past month and were ahead of year-ago sales . Much of the improvement , however , can be attributed to recent clearance promotions . Unseasonably warm weather continued to hamper sales of outerwear and other seasonal merchandise .

Although building and sales activity continued at high levels and wages for construction workers rose noticeably in the District 's fast-growth intermountain states and Oregon , several respondents in these states reported recent slowing in residential construction activity and plans . Reports also suggested some slowing in commercial construction in Idaho , Arizona , and Nevada . Financial Institutions Respondents representing banks and savings and loans reported strong loan demand and generally good credit conditions throughout the District . Reports from Southern California suggested somewhat improved conditions there , with increased loan demand at banking and thrift institutions ; however , delinquencies also have increased a bit . San Francisco Bay Area banks registered strong performance , although some deterioration in consumer loan quality was reported . Elsewhere in the District , financial institutions continued to do very well , despite sharp competition for loans .",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:31:23.9268011Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 7771, 16415, 892, 8967, 363, 5664, 4144, 13939, 1919, 278, 1880, 29899, 11345, 12012, 3864, 4818, 297, 278, 14841, 760, 310, 278, 3087, 8970, 6211, 18320, 1919, 322, 777, 5839, 786, 297, 3635, 1169, 363, 5224, 29899, 558, 7612, 4954, 6251, 3233, 6629, 17774, 471, 8967, 363, 14234, 8046, 869, 1152, 8046, 408, 263, 3353, 1919, 3138, 1919, 738, 5923, 9324, 19434, 471, 297, 1661, 690, 1693, 616, 2791, 1691, 2056, 20201, 616, 7632, 322, 16538, 3933, 4482, 472, 278, 2106, 3233, 869, 8512, 5214, 322, 16538, 6354, 7572, 472, 1880, 11174, 322, 281, 1179, 363, 7632, 17162, 11492, 8369, 2197, 297, 278, 7457, 525, 29879, 5172, 29899, 29887, 798, 386, 1006, 16476, 475, 5922, 322, 25203, 1919, 3196, 10049, 1237, 297, 1438, 5922, 8967, 7786, 5232, 292, 297, 20201, 616, 7632, 6354, 322, 13900, 869, 830, 4011, 884, 7829, 777, 5232, 292, 297, 12128, 7632, 297, 5163, 29745, 1919, 23716, 1919, 322, 26572, 1114, 869, 4231, 273, 1455, 28218, 29879, 2538, 2818, 1237, 15783, 24388, 322, 4048, 886, 322, 658, 550, 8967, 4549, 24806, 9667, 322, 6892, 1781, 16200, 5855, 10106, 278, 7457, 869, 830, 4011, 515, 14234, 8046, 7829, 10579, 16710, 5855, 727, 1919, 411, 11664, 24806, 9667, 472, 9124, 292, 322, 1468, 2027, 21561, 2056, 3138, 1919, 628, 262, 339, 15942, 884, 505, 11664, 263, 2586, 869, 3087, 8970, 6211, 18320, 24388, 15443, 4549, 4180, 1919, 5998, 777, 270, 1308, 1611, 362, 297, 21691, 24806, 11029, 471, 8967, 869, 15785, 3062, 297, 278, 7457, 1919, 18161, 21561, 7572, 304, 437, 1407, 1532, 1919, 15020, 15301, 13888, 363, 658, 550, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913], 'total_duration': 744080300, 'load_duration': 6342300, 'prompt_eval_count': 314, 'prompt_eval_duration': 278534000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 456089000}",0.35,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.3

Commercial construction activity continued to increase and the residential market , while softer than last year , remained strong . Manufacturing activity picked up from a brief slowdown in the second quarter , due in part to settled auto-related strikes . Lending activity was very strong in June and July and asset quality was reportedly improving .

One large retailer said that no one particular product segment was doing exceptionally well or exceptionally poorly , a statement that seemed to sum up the sentiment of most other contacts . Sales of apparel , most notably women 's , continued to outperform other items .

Compared to a year earlier , rents were up 3.6 percent in January , versus a 1.9 percent rise for all of 1996 . Residential real estate markets have been steady to stronger in early 1997 . Permits to build New York City apartments , which rose sharply in 1996 , remained high in January , suggesting brisk construction activity in 1997 . This , along with a wave of commercial-to-residential conversions , may be alleviating the shortage of multi-family units somewhat ? according to a large New York City real estate broker , prices of prime Manhattan co-ops and condos have been essentially flat since last summer , and were lower in December and January than a year earlier . The single-family market appears to be gaining momentum . Sales of existing homes across New York were up 5.7 percent from a year ago in January , with average prices up 5 percent . ( Apparently , the January 1996 sales pace was little affected by last year ? s blizzard . ) In New Jersey , both realtors and builders describe the housing market in January and February as stronger than in early 1996 ; in absolute levels , existing home sales are reported to be fairly high , but new home sales are still quite low .

'' Labor Markets Labor markets remained very tight through December and early January , although the steady decrease in the region 's unemployment rate appeared to have ended . The average unemployment rate , which began declining in mid-1992 , flattened out in the latter half of 1997 and may be trending upward ever so slightly . The major concern of employers , however , continued to be labor shortages . Though these shortages were broad-based , information technology and construction workers were most often cited as being in short supply and accounting professionals were again hard to find heading into the upcoming tax season . A major producer of high-tech equipment reported that some projects had to be scuttled because of the shortage of engineers . Homebuilders ' associations in Wisconsin recently began setting up recruiting booths at some of the state 's `` home shows . '' The shortages continued to hinder the District 's employment growth and most analysts contacted expect this to continue into 1998 . A survey of employers ' hiring plans forecasted that the Midwest 's payrolls would continue to expand in the first quarter of 1998 , with Detroit and Milwaukee area employers being the most optimistic .

Wage pressures generally remained subdued , with new reports of increasing wage gains generally confined to those occupations where skill levels were upgraded , such as upper-end administrative staff with project leadership or report writing skills .

Manufacturing materials were generally available , with only spotty evidence of marginal increases in lead times . Inventories last month were flat , and managers reported mixed feelings about their satisfaction with current stock levels . However , manufacturers plan to trim inventories somewhat in the near future . Housing Strong momentum continued in construction activity with builders reporting that housing starts remained relatively high last month , and well above year-ago levels . Builders expect a seasonal flattening in construction activity in the coming months . While sales of new homes were up again , they grew at a slower pace than in the recent past . The consistently strong sales have left inventories of unsold new homes at low levels . Mortgage lenders reported that demand last month was generally unchanged , but remained well above year-ago levels . Home purchases continued to account for close to half of mortgage activity . Although less optimistic than in our previous survey , lenders expect mortgage demand to stay modestly strong over the next three months as rates remain low .

Indeed , the rate of joblessness in some areas has descended to levels previously unseen ( about 2 % in the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region . ) The District 's temporary employment agencies were unable to keep pace with demand in February , and all of the agencies surveyed indicate having increased wages since the beginning of the year for a wide range of workers . Several agencies are preparing for another round of wage increases within the next few months . General laborers are in short supply in the southern parts of the District , even in the manufacturing sector where labor markets have been softer . Elsewhere , firms continue to report a shortage of administrative support , including experienced secretaries . District transporters report a leveling off in shipping activity this year , and business is modestly below levels of a year ago . International traffic has improved , as both imports and exports have grown since the last report . Imports remain especially strong , however , and the imbalance between imports and exports persists . Shippers are expected to hike rates on Asian routes to compensate for capacity excesses on return trips . Agricultural commodity prices , which have stabilized recently , are substantially below levels of a year ago , although dairy prices remain elevated .

New trucks and SUVs remained the hottest sellers , however , and most dealers complained of shortages of these vehicles . Like most other retailers , auto dealers remain very optimistic about sales in the near future . Manufacturing Tenth District manufacturing activity held steady last month , albeit at a relatively weak level . Plants were operating at similar capacities - medium to high - as in our previous survey , but still well below levels posted a year ago . Manufacturing materials were generally available with lead times practically unchanged , and managers had little concern about availability in the near future . Factories began modestly increasing inventories in March and early April , and managers were happier with current stock levels than in the recent past . The increases were small , however , and most survey contacts anticipate having to trim inventories in coming months as stiff competition from low-price imports continues . Housing Construction activity remained strong last month , although housing starts in some parts of the district were slightly below last year 's pace . Nearly all builders expect even better performance in the months ahead . For the first time in several surveys , a majority of builders complained of difficulties obtaining materials , particularly sheetrock .

A Minnesota iron ore mine production line reopened in September and two Michigan iron ore mines reopened in October . Most mine workers have agreed to a five-year contract , which should reduce the risk of work stoppages . Meanwhile , oil exploration activity has picked up . In October , 10 rigs were operating in North Dakota , three rigs in South Dakota and four rigs in Montana as compared to four , zero and four , respectively , in July . In addition , August oil production in the district was up 2 percent from June production levels . Agriculture Current crop production forecasts for the district suggest a bountiful harvest . Expected soybean , hay and sugarbeet production for Minnesota , the Dakotas and Montana in 1999 is above the hefty 1998 harvest levels . However , expected 1999 corn production in Minnesota and the Dakotas is 10 percent below the record 1998 harvest amounts , and 1999 small grain production in North Dakota is significantly below 1998 levels .

New York purchasing managers report that manufacturing activity expanded at a brisk pace in both June and July , following a dip in May . Buffalo-area purchasers report that production activity grew at about the same modest pace in July as in the second quarter , while new orders and employment levels were little changed . Surveys in both these areas indicate a noticeable pickup in prices for manufacturing inputs . There have been reports of significant shipping delays due to the merger of Conrail into CSX and Norfolk Southern , though contacts do not see any problems comparable to last year 's merger between Union Pacific and Southern Pacific . One contact at a short-line railroad in upstate New York says that , while delays persisted in July , they were not as bad as in June ; conditions are expected to be back to normal by around the end of October . Some shipping has been diverted to trucks , but not much . Hotel occupancy rates in New York City held steady throughout the second quarter at just above 80 percent -- a high level but about 5 points lower than a year earlier . After registering double-digit increases through much of 1998 , room rates are currently running just 2 percent higher than a year ago .

493,"planning conservatively for the coming holiday season . Most do not anticipate the strong sales growth that they experienced in the fourth quarter of last year and do not want to be left with excessive inventories after the holidays . Notably , many retailers are reducing their apparel inventories relative to a year ago . Construction Evidence of a slowdown in the District 's single-family residential market continues to emerge . Buyer traffic has been down recently in many parts of the District , while inventories have risen somewhat and the use of price concessions has increased . Both builders and realtors noted that home sales had weakened in early October . Contacts anticipate continued moderate slowing in the housing sector through the remainder of the year . Commercial real estate activity remained strong , with vacancy rates declining slightly in most markets . However , several contractors around the District have reported that construction activity is slowing , backlogs are shrinking , and there have been net declines in occupied space in many areas . Industry experts indicate that the market remains well positioned in general , and there continues to be little risk of oversaturation in the near term . Manufacturing Contacts paint a mixed picture of recent factory activity . Military contracts and high-tech industries are continuing to stimulate manufacturing activity in the District .

Recent congressional approval for the purchase of F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft and C-1390J Airlifters is a positive development for Lockheed Martin 's Marietta , Georgia , plant .",0.4,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:32:02.6811735Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.4\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 572, 9450, 8976, 6703, 363, 278, 6421, 8753, 22394, 4259, 869, 7849, 437, 451, 23483, 403, 278, 4549, 16538, 14321, 393, 896, 18860, 297, 278, 11582, 12616, 310, 1833, 1629, 322, 437, 451, 864, 304, 367, 2175, 411, 19163, 573, 11817, 3842, 1156, 278, 8753, 333, 1036, 869, 2216, 2197, 1919, 1784, 3240, 737, 414, 526, 27668, 1009, 623, 17243, 11817, 3842, 6198, 304, 263, 1629, 8020, 869, 5798, 4080, 7298, 5084, 310, 263, 5232, 3204, 297, 278, 7457, 525, 29879, 2323, 29899, 11922, 20201, 616, 9999, 18172, 304, 11176, 479, 869, 5373, 7598, 12469, 756, 1063, 1623, 10325, 297, 1784, 5633, 310, 278, 7457, 1919, 1550, 11817, 3842, 505, 5161, 264, 10579, 322, 278, 671, 310, 8666, 378, 985, 1080, 756, 11664, 869, 9134, 2048, 414, 322, 1855, 29873, 943, 11682, 393, 3271, 16538, 750, 8062, 6419, 297, 4688, 5533, 869, 22387, 29879, 23483, 403, 7572, 17768, 403, 5232, 292, 297, 278, 27261, 17535, 1549, 278, 21162, 310, 278, 1629, 869, 422, 1050, 1455, 1855, 19989, 6354, 9488, 4549, 1919, 411, 11757, 6906, 19257, 4845, 2827, 10029, 297, 1556, 2791, 1691, 869, 2398, 1919, 3196, 8078, 943, 2820, 278, 7457, 505, 8967, 393, 7632, 6354, 338, 5232, 292, 1919, 1250, 20756, 526, 14653, 18159, 1919, 322, 727, 505, 1063, 7787, 4845, 1475, 297, 16404, 2913, 297, 1784, 10161, 869, 12157, 719, 2902, 1372, 12266, 393, 278, 9999, 9242, 1532, 2602, 287, 297, 2498, 1919, 322, 727, 18172, 304, 367, 2217, 12045, 310, 288, 874, 1337, 362, 297, 278, 2978, 1840, 869, 2315, 9765, 3864, 22387, 29879, 10675, 263, 12849, 7623, 310, 7786, 12529, 6354, 869, 20080, 8078, 29879, 322, 1880, 29899, 11345, 6397, 2722, 526, 3133, 292, 304, 20436, 5987, 12012, 3864, 6354, 297, 278, 7457, 869, 13, 13, 4789, 296, 378, 11476, 284, 2134, 791, 363, 278, 20590, 310, 383, 29899, 29906, 29906, 390, 2156, 272, 285, 14643, 15780, 322, 315, 29899, 29896, 29941, 29929, 29900, 29967, 28299, 361, 2153, 338, 263, 6374, 5849, 363, 18199, 354, 287, 6502, 525, 29879, 1085, 2035, 941, 1919, 16762, 1919, 8024, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 29871, 29900, 29889, 29946, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 856901200, 'load_duration': 5576700, 'prompt_eval_count': 392, 'prompt_eval_duration': 348205000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 499807000}",0.35,0.4,-0.4,0.2,0.5

Most manufacturers are also seeing their business grow and indicate they are not raising prices . Labor markets remain tight . Most companies say base wages are rising at a 3 to 5 percent pace , although increasing numbers say they are raising wages more than this . In addition , temp firms report wages are up 5 to 10 percent from a year earlier . Firms continue to implement technologies or strategies that economize on labor and other inputs . Retail Most retail contacts report sales growth from year-earlier in the upper single-digit range for the December through mid-February period , at or slightly above expectations . Respondents in all sectors characterize their results as strong . Permanent employment is said to be holding steady . Most retailers indicate that base wages are increasing at a 3 to 5 percent rate , although overall compensation is increasing faster because of performance-based incentives . However , contacts in faster-growing sectors are raising wages at a 5 to 10 percent pace in order to attract scarce labor . Retailers continue to report little evidence of inflation except in the fast-growing tourist sector .

Contacts with temporary staffing services suggested that demand for manufacturing workers dropped off notably in the last 6-8 weeks , and there were some new reports of manufacturing layoffs in some areas . A few contacts at tech consulting firms reported that more workers were `` sitting on the bench '' as many projects had been cancelled . Also , higher fuel prices drove many independent truck drivers out of business , making it easier for larger haulers to find qualified drivers . For the most part , however , contacts continued to find it difficult to hire and retain qualified workers . Again this holiday shopping season , retailers were challenged to adequately staff their stores and there appeared to be a more concerted effort to lure retirees back into the workplace .

Economic activity was described as strong in most Federal Reserve Districts . Growth was characterized as solid in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts , and as moderate in the Districts of Atlanta and Chicago . Consumer spending growth was rapid during the holiday shopping period , and many retailers expect the high level of activity to continue into early 2000 . Manufacturing continued to expand in nearly every District and was broadly based across industries . Exceptions to this were in the food , apparel , agricultural equipment , and some construction-based industries . Residential real estate construction was mixed across regions , with the northeastern states experiencing an inventory shortage , the southern and midwestern states a slowdown , and the western states an expansion . Commercial construction activity varied across the country . Bank lending was mixed , with a decrease in mortgage lending that was often offset by increases in consumer and commercial lending . Labor markets remained tight in all Districts . However , the tight labor markets did not seem to be matched with large wage increases . Most consumer prices appear to be holding steady in much of the country , although a few Districts reported moderate increases . Producer prices also appear to be flat , with the exception of rising petroleum prices .

The steel industry in particular continues to show a great deal of strain as a result of strong foreign competition and weaker domestic demand . Retail stores experienced a slower-than-expected holiday season , as consumer spending remained soft . However , labor markets have remained fairly buoyant , although less so than they had been earlier in the year . Industrial Activity The steel industry is facing some tough times . Mills are operating 10 to 30 percent below capacity , domestic demand has slowed , and there is intense competition from foreign producers , in part due to the strong dollar . Several firms have filed for chapter 11 , and more filings are expected . January orders are a little stronger than December 's , but first-quarter orders are expected to be weak . Producers of specialty steel are in a better position . While prices on specialty steel products decreased along with carbon steel , orders for specialty steel remain stronger .

Consumer spending was mixed—aggressive financing incentives drove automobile and light truck sales to exceptional levels , but tourism remained weak and nonauto sales were spotty , with stronger sales growth in some areas offset by weaker sales elsewhere . Retailers ' outlook for spending during the upcoming holiday season was also mixed . Store managers had already begun discounting prices in some areas to counteract weak customer traffic , while in other areas retailers ' expectations for the season had brightened recently . Residential real estate generally held its own , with sales of moderately-priced homes steady and permits for new construction increasing modestly in all but a few regions . In contrast , the demand for commercial space eased further , pushing vacancy rates higher and rents lower in many areas . In the finance sector , the pace of residential mortgage refinancing activity accelerated as mortgage interest rates fell further .

Some contacts in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts , however , suggested that the sector may have bottomed . Most Districts reported that manufacturers continued to trim inventories and many suggested that further inventory reductions were in the offing . Soft demand and stiff competition , in many cases from foreign producers , kept downward pressure on selling prices , and most input prices were reportedly flat to down . Increases in new orders and production in machine tool and shipping/packaging materials were noted by Chicago and Minneapolis . Banking and Finance Overall lending activity was reported to be mixed , as household demand for loans remained strong in most areas while softness in business lending persisted . Over half of the District reports indicated that household lending activity remained relatively robust , with only Boston , New York , St. Louis , and San Francisco reporting a general softening .

520,"cyclical industries . Agriculture and Natural Resources The energy sector continues to expand . Despite recent easing in oil prices , contacts in the Dallas , Kansas City , and Minneapolis districts reported that oil and natural gas prices remain sufficiently high to promote continued expansion of exploration and production . However , Dallas and Kansas City reported that the pace of industry expansion is constrained by worker and equipment shortages . Given these shortages , the recent dramatic rise in natural gas prices is not expected to produce a further acceleration in drilling activity . Other extraction industries are not doing as well , as metal mining and processing activity in the Minneapolis district continued to decline in the face of falling commodity prices and high electricity costs . In the farm economy , the onset of winter weather across the country has had mixed effects . Minneapolis reported that moisture from heavy snowfalls has benefited the winter wheat crop and is expected to reduce the likelihood of drought conditions in the coming growing season . However , severe winter weather also contributed to a worsening in pasture conditions for livestock and an increased use of alternative forages in the Richmond , Minneapolis , Kansas City , and Dallas districts .

Strength continued in sales of both new and existing homes , while nonresidential building and real estate activities were again soft . Manufacturing activity remained generally weak but appeared to have improved further from our last report . Bankers continued to report strong mortgage demand from households and weak loan demand from businesses . There were a few new reports of input cost increases , particularly for energy , but prices at the retail level remained largely in check . District farmland values in 2002 posted the largest year-over-year gain since 1997 , even as concerns increased about the impact of drought and continued low dairy prices . Consumer Spending Overall consumer spending remained weak in January and February . Most retail contacts indicated that sales results in January fell short of their conservative expectations , although one national chain noted some slight improvement in February . Merchants said that sales of food and consumables were stronger than other items , particularly apparel . Inventories generally remained lean as retailers sought to tightly control stocks , although one merchant reported that inventories were rising faster than sales .

A contact in casual dining noted that sales had been softening since mid-January , in part because of bad weather and increased fears of terrorism .

545,"business demand was reflected in relatively flat loan volumes , a trend that has persisted over the past six months . Banks that did experience volume increases suggested that the gains were due to market share shifts rather than a general increase in demand . On balance , banks did not appear to be tightening standards on business loans , and there were a few reports that overall business loan quality had improved slightly . Prices and Employment Costs There were a few new reports of increasing input costs , but retail price increases remained largely subdued . Of particular concern to many contacts were rising prices of energy and inputs derived from petroleum . One contact said that prices for diesel fuel had risen to `` frighteningly high '' levels , which could potentially send some small freight carriers into bankruptcy . By contrast , steel prices were said to be stabilizing after some significant increases in 2002 . There were no new reports of intensifying pressure on wages , and some companies were said to have delayed merit increases until later in the year . Businesses continued to express concern over rising health and other insurance costs . Despite some increases in input costs , fierce price competition kept most output prices in check . Small-business owners appeared particularly concerned with this trend , as they were finding it increasingly difficult to compete with larger producers on price .

Though most contacts could not immediately discern the total impact , retail and manufacturing experienced the greatest impact as a result of closures . Other sectors of the economy experienced minor or no problems due to the electricity problems . Manufacturing Most manufacturing contacts reported continued improving conditions in July and August . However , unlike the previous report , a few contacts did note declines in both production and sales . Overall , both production and sales were higher during this period than in the most recent report and during the same time last year , with nondurable goods manufacturers generally citing more favorable conditions than durable goods producers . Inventory levels were flat during this time period , with idle capacity remaining relatively the same as well . While most manufacturers said they were maintaining their current workforce levels , the proportion of firms reporting new hires was greater than those cutting payrolls . Most contacts still anticipate moderate sales and production growth by year 's end . Auto production fell again at most District plants in July and early August compared with June , but it should be noted that many facilities re-tooled in early July . Regardless , same-model production was about 4 percent lower than 2002 levels . In July , three new models began production in the District . A few facilities reported the use of overtime .

In the steel industry , production was fairly stable between July and August ,",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:32:43.4961932Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 11102, 15201, 491, 278, 4628, 449, 297, 7145, 29899, 26197, 869, 14832, 1556, 25957, 1033, 451, 7389, 2313, 824, 278, 3001, 10879, 1919, 3240, 737, 322, 12012, 3864, 18860, 278, 14176, 10879, 408, 263, 1121, 310, 4694, 1973, 869, 5901, 409, 14359, 310, 278, 26504, 18860, 9461, 470, 694, 4828, 2861, 304, 278, 12646, 537, 4828, 869, 2315, 9765, 3864, 7849, 12012, 3864, 25957, 8967, 7572, 4857, 1747, 5855, 297, 5468, 322, 3111, 869, 2398, 1919, 25531, 278, 3517, 3461, 1919, 263, 2846, 25957, 1258, 4443, 4845, 1475, 297, 1716, 5802, 322, 16538, 869, 6811, 497, 1919, 1716, 5802, 322, 16538, 892, 6133, 2645, 445, 3785, 1135, 297, 278, 1556, 7786, 3461, 322, 2645, 278, 1021, 931, 1833, 1629, 1919, 411, 302, 898, 21115, 22535, 12012, 332, 414, 6892, 7537, 292, 901, 7853, 519, 5855, 1135, 1411, 519, 22535, 1391, 22543, 869, 512, 23886, 11174, 892, 12151, 2645, 445, 931, 3785, 1919, 411, 28132, 13284, 9886, 13774, 278, 1021, 408, 1532, 869, 5806, 1556, 12012, 332, 414, 1497, 896, 892, 7344, 292, 1009, 1857, 664, 10118, 11174, 1919, 278, 18618, 310, 13734, 1516, 23415, 716, 298, 2658, 471, 7621, 1135, 1906, 28967, 5146, 1245, 29879, 869, 7849, 25957, 1603, 23483, 403, 17768, 403, 16538, 322, 5802, 14321, 491, 1629, 525, 29879, 1095, 869, 11133, 5802, 8379, 1449, 472, 1556, 7457, 18577, 297, 5468, 322, 4688, 3111, 9401, 411, 5306, 1919, 541, 372, 881, 367, 11682, 393, 1784, 23330, 337, 29899, 517, 29877, 839, 297, 4688, 5468, 869, 2169, 538, 2222, 1919, 1021, 29899, 4299, 5802, 471, 1048, 29871, 29946, 10151, 5224, 1135, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29900, 29906, 11174, 869, 512, 5468, 1919, 2211, 716, 4733, 4689, 5802, 297, 278, 7457, 869, 319, 2846, 23330, 8967, 278, 671, 310, 975, 2230, 869, 13, 13, 797, 278, 22973, 13661, 1919, 5802, 471, 12558, 13714, 1546, 5468, 322, 3111, 1919, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913], 'total_duration': 788249800, 'load_duration': 5312200, 'prompt_eval_count': 358, 'prompt_eval_duration': 332029000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 448590000}",0.55,0.6,0.3,0.5,0.6

But other manufacturing activity was mostly flat or down . Activity in the service sector was also mixed . Retailers reported a drop in sales . Construction and real estate markets continued to be soft , and the financial service industry reported little change in activity . Overall agricultural conditions remained relatively stable in the last seven weeks . Contacts vary in their outlook for future activity . There is optimism in some industries that activity will pick up soon , as uncertainty surrounding the war dissipates . Other contacts are more pessimistic about the outlook than they were a few weeks ago . These contacts expressed concern that the economy is not necessarily going to bounce back quickly after the war because businesses are very reluctant to make capital investments until they are certain demand is picking up in their industry .

Energy activity picked up only mildly , despite a sharp increase in prices . Overall agricultural conditions were good . Geopolitical uncertainties still dampen consumer and business confidence . High energy prices also weigh heavily on the outlook for some industries . Hiring is minimal , according to contacts who say investments are on hold until questions surrounding the war are resolved . Contacts report that concerns about terrorism seem to be distracting attention from normal business .

The prices of heating oil and gasoline have followed crude oil upward . Gasoline prices at the pump reached the highest February level on record . High gasoline prices are expected to persist into the summer ; refiners would normally be building inventories of gasoline now but currently do not have the crude available to do so .

Wage growth remained largely unchanged from the previous survey , with most firms continuing to provide no more than cost-of-living wage increases . Rising employee benefit costs continued to be a concern for many firms , and some employers said they were passing more of the cost of insurance and pensions on to employees . Retailers reported some discounting of prices to clear out seasonal items , but overall prices were virtually unchanged from the previous survey . Retail prices are expected to remain stable in coming months . Manufacturers reported little change in finished goods prices and do not anticipate much change heading forward . However , transportation and energy costs , as well as prices for some petroleum-based materials , continued to edge higher . Builders reported a slight rise in prices for some construction materials , including lumber , but no further increases are expected .",0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:32:47.4569218Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 5498, 22543, 526, 16120, 263, 2253, 1629, 2861, 304, 23505, 9999, 26094, 322, 16710, 4940, 545, 5855, 869, 399, 1179, 322, 1588, 1575, 399, 1179, 322, 26094, 9488, 13774, 13714, 297, 5306, 322, 4688, 5468, 1919, 5998, 26094, 363, 777, 12012, 3864, 17279, 7572, 304, 7910, 869, 16715, 2791, 1691, 892, 1603, 3755, 269, 2364, 2820, 278, 6474, 1919, 411, 1556, 767, 18150, 23415, 2846, 23553, 27523, 1722, 11909, 1919, 1584, 363, 2071, 24455, 22873, 869, 2398, 1919, 278, 27725, 310, 6568, 2696, 7475, 29883, 4110, 321, 1463, 4340, 297, 5306, 322, 4688, 5468, 1919, 26233, 278, 10212, 9999, 1122, 367, 14712, 278, 11155, 869, 399, 482, 14321, 9488, 18425, 443, 15033, 515, 278, 3517, 18994, 1919, 411, 1556, 13734, 1516, 3133, 292, 304, 3867, 694, 901, 1135, 3438, 29899, 974, 29899, 29880, 4357, 281, 482, 16415, 869, 390, 5921, 19001, 14169, 21544, 7572, 304, 367, 263, 5932, 363, 1784, 13734, 1516, 1919, 322, 777, 5703, 414, 1497, 896, 892, 6819, 901, 310, 278, 3438, 310, 1663, 18541, 322, 282, 5580, 373, 304, 22873, 869, 4649, 737, 414, 8967, 777, 2313, 792, 292, 310, 26094, 304, 2821, 714, 4259, 284, 4452, 1919, 541, 12463, 26094, 892, 4610, 1474, 443, 15033, 515, 278, 3517, 18994, 869, 4649, 737, 26094, 526, 3806, 304, 3933, 13714, 297, 6421, 7378, 869, 2315, 9765, 332, 414, 8967, 2217, 1735, 297, 7743, 22535, 26094, 322, 437, 451, 23483, 403, 1568, 1735, 28435, 6375, 869, 2398, 1919, 8608, 362, 322, 5864, 21544, 1919, 408, 1532, 408, 26094, 363, 777, 5697, 12154, 398, 29899, 6707, 17279, 1919, 7572, 304, 7636, 6133, 869, 8878, 414, 8967, 263, 7248, 14451, 297, 26094, 363, 777, 7632, 17279, 1919, 3704, 301, 2807, 1919, 541, 694, 4340, 16415, 526, 3806, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 29871, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 839407700, 'load_duration': 5922700, 'prompt_eval_count': 339, 'prompt_eval_duration': 332929000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 499220000}",0.7,0.6,0.3,0.75,0.6

Manufacturers and purchasing managers indicate steady to improved activity in recent weeks and steady to lower prices . Port traffic is also described as strong . Housing markets and construction activity have shown further signs of slowing in recent weeks , especially at the upper end of the market , though the general level of activity remains robust . New York City 's office market showed signs of stabilizing in the final two months of 2002 , though rents were sharply lower than at the end of 2001 . Finally , bankers report increased demand for commercial loans and nonresidential mortgages , tighter lending standards in those same categories , and steady to lower delinquency rates . Consumer Spending Most retailers report that holiday sales in the district were disappointing . Sales were particularly sluggish during the first half of December and , sales for the month as a whole were mostly below plan . Some contacts note that unit sales were roughly on plan but that dollar volume was reduced",-0.4,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:32:53.4772923Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.4}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 29967, 15623, 653, 29871, 29896, 29945, 1919, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29900, 29941, 450, 6440, 7457, 525, 29879, 26504, 756, 1063, 12849, 1951, 278, 1833, 3461, 411, 8062, 2264, 297, 3240, 737, 16538, 322, 777, 2240, 292, 1283, 297, 278, 27261, 9999, 541, 411, 18906, 310, 263, 5839, 786, 297, 12012, 3864, 322, 777, 16160, 2133, 297, 12128, 1855, 19989, 869, 4649, 737, 414, 11149, 12266, 393, 8753, 22394, 322, 1400, 29899, 5391, 22394, 16538, 892, 2400, 3814, 2056, 1716, 269, 7807, 26094, 322, 2778, 305, 392, 895, 21544, 892, 5439, 408, 27357, 304, 5224, 1135, 263, 1629, 8020, 1919, 541, 3240, 737, 11817, 3842, 892, 1497, 304, 367, 472, 10933, 519, 11174, 869, 2315, 9765, 332, 414, 322, 10596, 5832, 767, 18150, 12266, 27357, 304, 16710, 6354, 297, 7786, 11405, 322, 27357, 304, 5224, 26094, 869, 3371, 12469, 338, 884, 5439, 408, 4549, 869, 379, 681, 292, 2791, 1691, 322, 7632, 6354, 505, 4318, 4340, 18906, 310, 5232, 292, 297, 7786, 11405, 1919, 7148, 472, 278, 7568, 1095, 310, 278, 9999, 1919, 2466, 278, 2498, 3233, 310, 6354, 9242, 16424, 869, 1570, 3088, 4412, 525, 29879, 8034, 9999, 10018, 18906, 310, 16160, 5281, 297, 278, 2186, 1023, 7378, 310, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29900, 29906, 1919, 2466, 364, 1237, 892, 15301, 368, 5224, 1135, 472, 278, 1095, 310, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29900, 29896, 869, 9788, 1919, 9124, 414, 3461, 11664, 9667, 363, 12128, 658, 550, 322, 1661, 690, 1693, 616, 5758, 29887, 1179, 1919, 260, 14643, 301, 2548, 20801, 297, 1906, 1021, 13997, 1919, 322, 27357, 304, 5224, 628, 262, 23860, 19257, 869, 2138, 4680, 1706, 2548, 7849, 3240, 737, 414, 3461, 393, 8753, 22394, 16538, 297, 278, 6474, 892, 23451, 292, 869, 28389, 892, 10734, 2243, 12981, 728, 2645, 278, 937, 4203, 310, 5846, 322, 1919, 16538, 363, 278, 4098, 408, 263, 3353, 892, 11149, 2400, 3814, 869, 3834, 25957, 4443, 393, 5190, 16538, 892, 20928, 373, 3814, 541, 393, 11232, 279, 7977, 471, 12212, 32007, 32001, 8853, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29946, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 722799600, 'load_duration': 6425400, 'prompt_eval_count': 376, 'prompt_eval_duration': 346795000, 'eval_count': 11, 'eval_duration': 366722000}",0.3,0.3,0.2,0.2,0.2

Finally , firms that were expanding planned to continue to add to their staffs . After recent reports indicated better business conditions for nonresidential builders , activity appeared to slow in the six weeks through the middle of November . However , many contacts attributed this to a normal seasonal slowing . While many firms do n't anticipate much more activity through the remainder of this year , there is optimism about stronger activity in 2005 .

579,"September 8 , 2004 Reports from the Federal Reserve Banks indicated that economic activity continued to expand in late July and August , although several districts indicated that the pace had slowed since their last reports . Districts ' characterizations of the rate of expansion ranged from slow ( St. Louis ) to solid ( San Francisco ) , with many districts reporting modest or moderate growth . Household spending was reported to have softened in many parts of the nation , reflecting lackluster retail sales and some cooling in new and existing home sales . Conditions in the manufacturing sector , on the other hand , improved further nationwide , especially among capital equipment and other durable goods makers . Residential construction activity remained at high levels but slowed a bit in some regions ; nonresidential construction remained tepid , as did demand for commercial and industrial space . Agricultural conditions were mixed and generally tied to the weather . Demand for consumer loans softened somewhat , but several districts noted increased commercial lending . Employers in most districts continued to expand payrolls , though districts reported some unevenness across sectors . While persistently rapid increases in nonwage labor costs continued to be a concern for many employers , wage pressures remained modest . Consumer prices were generally flat or up modestly , although there were noticeable price increases for energy and some material inputs .

581,"the third quarter -- Realtors report that selling prices remained more than 15 percent ahead of a year ago , and the number of homes sold was up roughly 6 percent . Similarly , in Manhattan 's co-op and condo market , selling prices per square foot were up 4 percent to 5 percent from the second quarter and up 15 percent from a year earlier ; the volume of transactions was up marginally , though contacts report that this is partly a function of a low inventory of homes on the market . Manhattan 's rental market has been generally stable since the last report : one contact reports that , following a dip in the second half of September , leasing activity has picked up again in October -- particularly at the high end -- though rents remain flat . Office markets in the New York City area were again mixed in the third quarter . Manhattan 's office market was little changed overall , as continued gradual improvement in Midtown Manhattan offset an upturn in vacancies in Lower Manhattan . Outside New York City , conditions were also mixed : Long Island 's vacancy rate declined for the fourth consecutive quarter , falling to a three-year low , but northern New Jersey 's vacancy rate climbed to 18 percent , the highest level in nearly a decade . Rates were virtually unchanged in New York City 's northern suburbs -- Fairfield and Westchester Counties .

Another factor buoying property values is rising construction costs .

Some retailers cite recent reductions in consumer spending resulting from high gasoline prices , which they predicted earlier , but had not yet observed six or 12 weeks ago . Manufacturers are facing cost increases , but vary considerably in their ability to raise their own prices . Residential real estate markets in New England are becoming `` more reasonable '' as they cool slightly from record highs . Retail Retail respondents in the First District report mixed results for the quarter ending in September . While the quarter 's sales were mostly ahead of year-earlier levels , several contacts note a marked slowdown in the closing weeks . According to one contact in the apparel industry , same-store sales were up more than 4 percent in the third quarter partly due to better merchandising decisions , but year-to-date sales are virtually unchanged from last year . Another apparel contact noted that same-store sales were either up marginally or flat compared with a year ago in the months of August and September , with overall year-to-date sales still up just slightly from last year . Both respondents emphasized the negative impact skyrocketing fuel prices are having and threaten to continue to have on consumer spending .

Finally , new home prices have , in general , remained relatively stable throughout the District . Unlike their counterparts in residential building , nonresidential contractors continued to characterize business conditions as improving . Nonresidential builders reported increases in activity relative to a year ago , and indicated that their backlogs were rising . One contact noted that his firm 's backlog was big enough to keep it occupied through the end of 2006 . Still , most contacts considered profit margins to be tight , due to both reasonably intense competition and increases in materials costs . Prices for petroleum-based products , and especially for fuel , have been particularly difficult to estimate and include in bids .

Hiring among general contractors continued to be fairly limited , though demand for work from subcontractors increased in July and August , with several contacts citing rising subcontractor rates .

Contacts in Oklahoma reported that several small independent drillers were reopening older wells , which can be operated profitably with sustained high oil and natural gas prices . Most contacts continued to report that drilling was being constrained by shortages of rigs , equipment , and workers , but firms generally expect further increases in drilling in the months ahead . Agriculture Agricultural conditions in the district remained generally positive in late October and early November . Warm and dry weather continued through the first half of November , contributing to favorable conditions for field work and pushing the emergence of winter wheat ahead of normal . The harvesting of major fall crops was ahead of last year 's schedule and in line with five-year averages . Contacts expect large harvests even though yields will be off slightly . Conditions for livestock producers remained favorable due to lower grain prices . Incomes for both livestock and crop producers are expected to be strong in 2005 , although higher energy costs continue to be a major concern .

Demand for residential construction products has been soft , but sales to the energy industry remain strong .

Primary metals producers reported little change in demand overall , with strong demand for commercial building helping compensate for slowing activity from the residential sector .",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:33:33.7834031Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 29893, 406, 1407, 4549, 322, 15592, 630, 445, 4098, 1919, 607, 25957, 5352, 304, 5224, 10489, 26496, 26094, 14505, 292, 27144, 6354, 869, 4432, 392, 756, 5232, 287, 363, 1034, 11124, 630, 16273, 1919, 322, 25957, 297, 445, 13661, 505, 4953, 3109, 6374, 1048, 278, 714, 6914, 869, 5057, 29899, 11345, 12012, 332, 414, 1497, 7751, 1860, 892, 1603, 4549, 1919, 541, 727, 338, 7572, 25812, 1048, 278, 714, 6914, 869, 4432, 392, 7572, 304, 5232, 363, 9316, 1304, 297, 20201, 616, 7632, 1919, 541, 777, 13734, 1516, 1497, 7786, 5232, 292, 1122, 505, 1063, 22039, 14826, 29899, 12817, 869, 7138, 22543, 310, 12565, 1919, 1067, 388, 322, 12917, 8967, 16538, 4845, 1475, 310, 408, 1568, 408, 29871, 29906, 29900, 10151, 515, 263, 1629, 8020, 1919, 322, 11817, 3842, 526, 701, 363, 777, 9316, 869, 365, 2807, 1391, 22543, 8967, 263, 7282, 5768, 297, 9667, 322, 7910, 297, 11817, 706, 975, 278, 4940, 4098, 1919, 11149, 1363, 310, 12212, 9667, 515, 4797, 2791, 1691, 1919, 5998, 16538, 297, 10319, 892, 884, 591, 5790, 869, 7138, 22543, 310, 8112, 9316, 1919, 1316, 408, 28830, 1691, 1919, 1827, 9667, 338, 443, 15033, 869, 319, 2846, 1391, 22543, 310, 7632, 29899, 12817, 9316, 3461, 393, 777, 2919, 970, 368, 29899, 509, 11932, 2048, 414, 505, 2665, 8721, 6721, 363, 8666, 3724, 1953, 304, 1371, 963, 6176, 12616, 368, 17869, 410, 24247, 869, 910, 756, 5331, 1391, 22543, 304, 4953, 281, 653, 1048, 2599, 5381, 411, 1438, 2048, 414, 869, 10629, 2200, 630, 1539, 1338, 1391, 22543, 3461, 694, 1735, 297, 16538, 7977, 541, 750, 4953, 901, 5994, 4695, 869, 4432, 392, 363, 20201, 616, 7632, 9316, 756, 1063, 4964, 1919, 541, 16538, 304, 278, 5864, 13661, 3933, 4549, 869, 13, 13, 26666, 1539, 1338, 1391, 22543, 8967, 2217, 1735, 297, 9667, 12463, 1919, 411, 4549, 9667, 363, 12128, 5214, 19912, 22874, 403, 363, 5232, 292, 6354, 515, 278, 20201, 616, 17535, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 845404400, 'load_duration': 7902900, 'prompt_eval_count': 370, 'prompt_eval_duration': 344641000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 489592000}",0.55,0.3,-0.2,0.25,0.3

Several Districts characterized the overall pace of economic growth as `` moderate '' or `` modest , '' although San Francisco reported that its economic expansion remained `` solid '' and Atlanta and St. Louis described overall conditions as `` mixed . '' The Philadelphia , Cleveland , Richmond , Chicago , Dallas , and San Francisco reports each highlighted a decline in the overall rate of economic growth in their Districts . Most reports on retail sales indicated slightly weaker conditions , on balance , than earlier in the year . But tourist spending remained robust , albeit with evidence of slower growth in some areas , and activity expanded for providers of nonfinancial services to businesses and consumers . Reports from the manufacturing sector were strong , with significant gains in output and sales , especially for durable goods .

In the metropolitan areas of Boston , Hartford , and Providence , office rent growth appears close to zero after concessions are taken into account . The industrial property market has been very weak in both Connecticut and Rhode Island -- in the latter case , vacancies are up and rents are down ( both modestly ) compared to last year . Sales activity is limited as credit remains very tight and buyers and sellers hold out for their preferred prices . Investment sales and new construction have been hit particularly hard . For example , three major building projects in downtown Boston ( office and mixed-use high rises ) are said to be currently languishing as they scramble to obtain tenant commitments and financing . As evidence that property valuations have fallen relative to operating incomes , sources report that capitalization rates for commercial property in greater Boston are now approaching 7 percent , up from last summer 's estimated 5 percent . Despite enjoying brisk business and high commercial mortgage interest rates , a small Boston mutual bank foresees that it could run up against lending capacity constraints before year 's end . Accordingly , lending officers at the bank have been instructed to adopt a `` more selective '' stance .

In the financial sector , several contacts in the mortgage industry reported pressure on margins for residential mortgages from recent pricing increases in the secondary market . Wage pressures remained limited outside of skilled labor positions that continue to experience shortages . Agriculture Crop conditions improved in the District as sufficient moisture remained from earlier rains to offset dry weather in August . Replanted fields may boost soybean production above current published estimates . Contacts reported that corn and soybean fields were at least two weeks behind the typical stages of development , making crop yields more vulnerable than usual to an early frost . Concerns about risks for 2009 grew as farmers faced higher planting costs while having fewer options to lock in prices for their crops . These circumstances have led parties in transactions to more fully investigate the financial health of their counterparties . Hay supplies improved with new cuttings , and pastures were in good shape . Corn and soybean prices fell during the reporting period . However , livestock producers still struggled with high feed costs . Hog producers benefited from higher hog prices .

Lower corn prices eased margins for several ethanol producers reducing delays and allowing some new plants to start production .",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:34:09.0908695Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 29889, 1670, 892, 884, 3196, 13676, 310, 1209, 29899, 20678, 310, 1438, 6133, 21544, 304, 1623, 5461, 26094, 1919, 394, 6205, 304, 263, 1407, 9078, 15834, 363, 6397, 2722, 1316, 408, 20201, 616, 7632, 322, 3240, 737, 11302, 869, 512, 278, 18161, 17535, 1919, 3196, 25957, 297, 278, 5758, 29887, 482, 13661, 8967, 12959, 373, 15276, 1144, 363, 20201, 616, 5758, 29887, 1179, 515, 7786, 544, 18499, 16415, 297, 278, 16723, 9999, 869, 399, 482, 3965, 1973, 9488, 9078, 5377, 310, 2071, 24455, 10212, 11909, 393, 6773, 304, 7271, 3273, 1179, 869, 27051, 545, 315, 1336, 5855, 16710, 297, 278, 7457, 408, 8002, 2730, 391, 545, 9488, 515, 8859, 1153, 1144, 304, 9210, 15589, 14826, 297, 3111, 869, 830, 572, 9714, 4235, 1122, 14505, 577, 29891, 14471, 5802, 2038, 1857, 6369, 21875, 869, 22387, 29879, 8967, 393, 26343, 322, 577, 29891, 14471, 4235, 892, 472, 3203, 1023, 11405, 5742, 278, 15662, 22950, 310, 5849, 1919, 3907, 274, 1336, 17498, 901, 23180, 519, 1135, 9670, 304, 385, 4688, 14671, 303, 869, 23924, 824, 29879, 1048, 5161, 2039, 363, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29900, 29929, 13631, 408, 2215, 13269, 20050, 6133, 8024, 292, 21544, 1550, 2534, 28145, 3987, 304, 7714, 297, 26094, 363, 1009, 8182, 567, 869, 4525, 14209, 505, 5331, 13973, 297, 22160, 304, 901, 8072, 23033, 278, 18161, 9045, 310, 1009, 6795, 1595, 583, 869, 11389, 28075, 16710, 411, 716, 274, 4774, 886, 1919, 322, 4940, 1973, 892, 297, 1781, 8267, 869, 11655, 322, 577, 29891, 14471, 26094, 8379, 2645, 278, 23415, 3785, 869, 2398, 1919, 7294, 342, 1698, 1391, 22543, 1603, 10205, 839, 411, 1880, 8343, 21544, 869, 27675, 1391, 22543, 7795, 1573, 515, 6133, 298, 468, 26094, 869, 13, 13, 19357, 26343, 26094, 321, 1463, 15276, 1144, 363, 3196, 11314, 273, 324, 1391, 22543, 27668, 628, 1036, 322, 14372, 777, 716, 18577, 304, 1369, 5802, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913], 'total_duration': 812674600, 'load_duration': 6847200, 'prompt_eval_count': 358, 'prompt_eval_duration': 344819000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 457049000}",0.45,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.3
659,"July 23 , 2008 Economic activity in the Seventh District was sluggish in June . Consumer spending was mixed and labor market conditions weakened some , although they continued to vary by location . Residential construction declined further and nonresidential construction showed signs of slowing . Manufacturing activity weakened slightly . Consumer lending declined , while business lending was stable . Cost pressures from rising material and energy prices remained high , while wage pressures continued to be low . Flooding and cool weather further set back crop conditions in June , although they improved toward the end of the month and in early July . Consumer Spending Consumer spending was mixed since the previous reporting period . Federal tax rebates and increased discounting boosted retail sales , but spending on automobiles slowed . Consumers continued to tighten their budgets in response to higher food and energy prices . Spending on discretionary items such as furniture , apparel , and electronics decreased and gasoline consumption fell , while food service sales were flat . Higher fuel prices discouraged travel , leading to a slowdown in tourism . Tourism was also adversely affected by inclement weather and flooding in some areas of the District .

Sales by District retailers and auto dealers were generally flat . Declines in coal production have leveled out , with oil and gas output holding steady . Reports indicated little change in freight transport volume . Business and consumer lending weakened further , while core deposits continued to grow . Large scale employment reductions have flattened out across most sectors , with some companies recalling a small number of workers . Staffing firm representatives reported an uptick in job openings across a wide spectrum of industries . Given the weak labor market , wage pressures are contained . We heard many reports of fluctuating commodity prices , especially from manufacturers and food producers . Otherwise , construction materials and product pricing were relatively stable .

688,". Reduced global demand and lower prices for oil have prompted a sharp cutback in oil extraction activity since last fall , with Dallas noting an `` unprecedented '' decline in the domestic rig count that was largely concentrated in their District . Respondents from the Kansas City District expect oil extraction activity to fall further as the year proceeds , and Minneapolis noted that natural gas and mining activities also faltered during the reporting period . Prices and Wages Upward price pressures were very limited during the reporting period , as a result of lower energy and commodity prices and weak demand for final goods and services across a wide range of sectors . The lower prices of energy and raw materials generally were passed on and contributed to downward pressure on the final prices of various products , according to Chicago and Dallas . Prices dropped on selected retail items in the Philadelphia , Kansas City , and San Francisco Districts , as discounting was widespread . Selected food products were a notable exception to downward price pressures , with Philadelphia reporting that some food processors raised their product prices .

Inventories remained tight , particularly for popular vehicles . Used car prices rose , reflective of solid demand and lean inventories . Respondents ' outlooks were for slight growth in sales through year-end . Reports from most Districts pointed to continued improvement in travel and tourist activity . The Richmond District reported that tourist activity strengthened , and contacts in San Francisco noted that growth in business travel and convention activity led to rising visitor counts and hotel occupancy rates . Hotel occupancy for popular tourist destinations in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts also rose during the reporting period and was above year-ago levels . New York 's report noted that hotel occupancy rates remained high in Manhattan , but October bookings were somewhat weaker than expected .

Overall , 38 percent of all small businesses polled applied for credit , compared with 32 percent in our Q2 survey . Employment and Prices Contacts suggest that employment plans remained subdued across much of the District . Employers expect hiring to be modest , mostly to fill seasonal positions or critical vacancies caused by attrition .

Many contacts noted plans to continue using temporary employees until there is a significant and sustained pickup in demand . Companies also indicated that they did not have any plans to cut",-0.5,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:34:44.0063808Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.5\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 6360, 869, 16795, 13734, 1516, 274, 1573, 4549, 3345, 327, 573, 7751, 1860, 322, 1407, 4549, 11174, 310, 17148, 17040, 267, 2731, 1312, 363, 5609, 869, 5593, 17040, 19638, 414, 11682, 393, 896, 505, 5224, 287, 3005, 523, 410, 24247, 363, 278, 1629, 1363, 310, 5224, 9667, 322, 6133, 26413, 21544, 869, 319, 2846, 25957, 23483, 630, 878, 342, 13284, 5700, 29879, 297, 278, 2978, 1840, 869, 10253, 292, 322, 4231, 749, 10253, 292, 25957, 5439, 301, 2548, 5855, 408, 8062, 1363, 310, 263, 10296, 310, 4964, 24806, 9667, 515, 18698, 27942, 414, 322, 9406, 24378, 7606, 11780, 869, 3831, 273, 583, 7572, 304, 10032, 1009, 2553, 29873, 15376, 322, 9078, 13184, 13900, 322, 7483, 28473, 869, 530, 1871, 284, 21180, 310, 1749, 2319, 5381, 25957, 17845, 393, 263, 2243, 326, 13638, 310, 286, 1535, 13734, 1516, 4520, 599, 470, 1556, 310, 278, 2989, 5253, 310, 6909, 13877, 1919, 1550, 1784, 4123, 5381, 267, 8967, 15399, 363, 16200, 304, 7985, 1009, 5381, 541, 892, 2845, 17935, 470, 12520, 443, 16044, 519, 16200, 4958, 869, 438, 3341, 892, 2313, 283, 1431, 287, 515, 15399, 363, 16200, 1363, 310, 278, 23227, 393, 896, 723, 2845, 367, 17935, 470, 367, 12520, 29395, 17118, 519, 4958, 869, 6811, 497, 1919, 29871, 29941, 29947, 10151, 310, 599, 2319, 5381, 267, 1248, 839, 7436, 363, 16200, 1919, 9401, 411, 29871, 29941, 29906, 10151, 297, 1749, 660, 29906, 18994, 869, 7361, 22812, 322, 1588, 1575, 22387, 29879, 4368, 393, 5703, 358, 13900, 9488, 1014, 700, 287, 4822, 1568, 310, 278, 7457, 869, 7361, 2376, 414, 2149, 298, 8491, 304, 367, 878, 342, 1919, 11149, 304, 5445, 4259, 284, 11909, 470, 12187, 11757, 273, 2478, 8581, 491, 12421, 654, 869, 13, 13, 14804, 25957, 11682, 13900, 304, 6773, 773, 13201, 22873, 2745, 727, 338, 263, 7282, 322, 15075, 7114, 5839, 786, 297, 9667, 869, 3831, 273, 583, 884, 18694, 393, 896, 1258, 451, 505, 738, 13900, 304, 5700, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29945, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 854267500, 'load_duration': 6290100, 'prompt_eval_count': 371, 'prompt_eval_duration': 345356000, 'eval_count': 15, 'eval_duration': 499355000}",0.4,0.3,-0.3,0.2,0.3

Residential Real Estate Residential real estate markets throughout New England experienced significant declines in sales and median prices in April compared to a year earlier . Contacts attribute the sales declines to the homebuyer tax credit , which boosted sales for the first half of last year .

On the other hand , dealers in the Buffalo area report that sales were down slightly from a year earlier in November and remained fairly sluggish in December ; the inclement weather was seen to be a factor . Tourism activity in New York City has remained fairly brisk since the last report . Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates remained close to 90 percent in November and December , while room rates continued to run nearly 10 percent ahead of comparable 2009 levels . The late-December snowstorm appears to have had little net effect on occupancy : while many visitors had to cancel their reservations , others who were unable to leave extended their stays . Broadway theaters report that both attendance and total revenues were running about 10 percent ahead of a year earlier in late November",0.75,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:34:58.1166625Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.75\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 18687, 8247, 869, 7803, 2919, 286, 4293, 297, 701, 3859, 1570, 3088, 3461, 7300, 29899, 6707, 9324, 297, 16538, 1919, 15020, 15007, 303, 555, 29879, 373, 6054, 28728, 322, 1449, 297, 4688, 5846, 2056, 12469, 471, 1506, 3873, 363, 1556, 310, 278, 8753, 22394, 4259, 1919, 9213, 491, 263, 27357, 4972, 310, 11443, 528, 9354, 414, 869, 7849, 3240, 737, 25957, 3461, 393, 896, 298, 2859, 10579, 901, 8753, 22394, 4259, 17162, 297, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29896, 29900, 1135, 297, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29900, 29929, 869, 15854, 5249, 16538, 892, 12849, 541, 6892, 472, 7853, 519, 11174, 1919, 408, 1716, 3240, 737, 322, 377, 6544, 744, 16200, 5855, 7572, 304, 11157, 869, 1528, 10530, 29899, 6203, 5376, 414, 3461, 393, 16538, 310, 716, 1120, 359, 1190, 3192, 29871, 29906, 29946, 10151, 515, 263, 1629, 8020, 297, 3979, 322, 2615, 304, 367, 2734, 1048, 29871, 29896, 29900, 10151, 14432, 297, 5846, 1919, 9213, 491, 297, 1760, 3145, 869, 1551, 278, 916, 1361, 1919, 5376, 414, 297, 278, 22274, 7003, 4038, 3461, 393, 16538, 892, 1623, 10029, 515, 263, 1629, 8859, 297, 3979, 322, 9488, 12558, 2243, 12981, 728, 297, 5846, 2056, 278, 5528, 944, 14826, 471, 3595, 304, 367, 263, 7329, 869, 6371, 1608, 6354, 297, 1570, 3088, 4412, 756, 9488, 12558, 1506, 3873, 1951, 278, 1833, 3461, 869, 29093, 23586, 7375, 1379, 3461, 393, 6919, 6906, 19257, 9488, 3802, 304, 29871, 29929, 29900, 10151, 297, 3979, 322, 5846, 1919, 1550, 5716, 19257, 7572, 304, 1065, 8886, 29871, 29896, 29900, 10151, 14432, 310, 5734, 519, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29900, 29929, 11174, 869, 450, 5683, 29899, 6185, 1096, 15007, 303, 555, 5692, 304, 505, 750, 2217, 7787, 2779, 373, 6919, 6906, 584, 1550, 1784, 26824, 750, 304, 12611, 1009, 620, 6972, 800, 1919, 4045, 1058, 892, 9368, 304, 5967, 10410, 1009, 27111, 869, 23291, 278, 10412, 3461, 393, 1716, 14333, 749, 322, 3001, 20957, 1041, 892, 2734, 1048, 29871, 29896, 29900, 10151, 14432, 310, 263, 1629, 8859, 297, 5683, 3979, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 29871, 29900, 29889, 29955, 29945, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 923632100, 'load_duration': 5567200, 'prompt_eval_count': 379, 'prompt_eval_duration': 352697000, 'eval_count': 16, 'eval_duration': 562497000}",0.7,0.8,0.7,0.8,0.8

'' In general , manufacturing contacts ' recent weakness has not yet led them to revise substantially their capital expenditure plans . That said , many of these plans involve spending outside the United States . For example , a manufacturer of lab equipment is spending almost 50 percent more this year than is typical , but all that increment involves a new plant in England ; capital expenditure in the U.S. is entirely on maintenance . Software and Information Technology Services New England software and information technology services contacts generally report weaker-than-expected activity through October , with revenues in the third quarter roughly on par with year-earlier levels . The downtick in activity reportedly reflects heightened political and economic uncertainty , which has rendered many potential clients unwilling to commit to projects . Many contacts report increasing difficulty in executing large license agreements , particularly in Europe , where one contact says sluggishness in the manufacturing sector led to a year-over-year decline in license revenue of nearly 40 percent .

Banking contacts reported modest growth in small business loan demand , but also slower growth in debt restructuring and leveraged finance deals as well as lower utilization of credit lines . Contacts attributed the decrease in credit demand from middle market customers to heightened uncertainty about future tax rates on capital spending .

Construction contacts also reported an increase in prices of raw materials such as lumber .

Manufacturing Since the last Beige Book , Third District manufacturers have reported virtually no change in shipments and just the slightest decline in new orders . Gains continue among the makers of food products , lumber and wood products , fabricated metals , industrial machinery , and instruments . Firms in the primary metals and electronic equipment industries report a fall-off in demand . According to various contacts , growth is attributed to warm weather , automotive demand , production returning from China , Marcellus Shale activity , and renewed customer optimism . About eight out of 10 Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve or stay the same during the next six months â€ “ somewhat less optimistic than reported in the last Beige Book . Except for primary metals , optimism is present in all major sectors . Firms seem relatively divided as to whether high energy costs are a concern , depending largely on their ability to pass the cost along to their customers . New to the list of concerns and uncertainties about the outlook is the increasing worry that political gridlock will lead to large cuts in defense-related production through sequestration . While caution remains , firms have reported a little more optimism as have their customers .

Commercial contractors noted a strong year to date as construction levels improved from late last year . Overall , manufacturing activity remained positive as new orders and production increased .

756,"Another contact said he was , `` increasingly nervous that there is another little slowdown here . '' But many other contacts are quite optimistic , including a firm that had disappointing results in 2013 , where the contact expects 2014 to be better . Selected Business Services Consulting and advertising contacts report a strong third quarter , consistent with a sustainably , but not rapidly , growing economy . Healthcare consultants cite the strongest results , as the double-digit revenue growth of the past few years continues . Demand for healthcare consulting services is driven by increased merger and acquisition activity among providers , adoption of new technology , compliance with new regulations , and the need for organizational change due to structural shifts in the healthcare industry . Demand for economic consulting remains strong , and strategy consultants report that `` the economy is slowly picking up steam . '' Marketing contacts estimate industry-wide growth of 6 percent to 7 percent , driven by large corporate orders and a shift in demand towards higher-value items as companies have more to spend on marketing and branding . By contrast , a government consultant reports a slight drop in revenues and a smaller backlog as the sequester continues to reduce agencies ' ability to purchase services .

According to contacts , slight increases in interest rates will likely spur more buyer activity in the short term as households try to lock in historically low interest rates . In Massachusetts , particularly in the Greater Boston area , inventory levels remain low , placing upward pressure on prices . Contacts in the Greater Boston area caution that inventory remains the most significant constraint on sales growth . In other parts of the First District , smaller cities report depleting inventory levels in urban centers , though realtors in these areas feel that a sufficient number of homes are available to satisfy prospective buyers . In contrast to much of the region , Rhode Island maintains a high level of inventory , but that market appears to be recovering as sales activity and prices continue to increase . Contacts expect sales activity and the median sale price to continue their upward trend . Inventory levels will likely remain an issue in urban areas due to a lack of new construction there . Contacts anticipate that homeowners may be more inclined to list their home for sale as house values continue to appreciate .

Our contacts attributed this trend to low interest rates , favorable prices , and an improving labor market . One builder commented that young people are less inclined to buy a house than were their parents due to a perceived lack of value and a desire for mobility . He believes that this reluctance may put downward pressure on the housing industry for years to come . New home contracts were found mostly in the mid- to higher-price-point categories . Demand for multifamily housing remains strong . Builders expressed confidence that the turnaround in the housing market will persist in the upcoming months . However , they cited difficulty in obtaining financing and low inventory as barriers to more robust growth in their industry . List prices of new homes increased by as much as 10 percent in certain markets this year due primarily to rising construction costs . Builders have cut back on discounting . Nonresidential builders told us that while inquiries have weakened , there were still a large number of projects in the development phase . However , backlogs are lower than what most builders would like . The strongest activity was in multifamily housing , energy , and manufacturing . The office and large-footprint retail segments were relatively weak . Our contacts are cautious about near-term activity .

In particular , general services and commercial real estate leasing continued to expand at modest rates . Activity in staffing services , transportation services , and residential construction appear to have accelerated somewhat to a modest rate of growth . Sales of new and used autos maintained a moderate rate of growth -- joined by general retail sales that grew a bit faster than last period and by residential real estate sales that grew a bit slower . The manufacturing sector reversed course again , citing slight declines in overall demand . Lending volumes at Third District banks continued to grow slightly , and credit quality continued to improve . Ski resorts are enjoying a good season overall , while Atlantic City casino revenues continue to decline .

Despite these rather mixed results , contacts continue to believe that the U.S. economy is improving -- one source terms the recent weakness `` just a hiccup . '' Boston hotel revenues were up 4.8 percent year-over-year in 2014 : Q1 . In April , Boston-area hotel occupancy rates were above 90 percent , which is unusually high , and observers say they expect hotel revenues to exceed those posted for April 2013 . Some of this increase is due to business related to the 2014 Marathon , which had almost 36,000 entrants compared to about 17,600 in 2013 . Boston area restaurants also did well in April , although final numbers are not yet in . For 2014 : Q1 , Boston restaurant revenues were up 4.9 percent over 2013 : Q1 -- this breaks down as flat in January , a 3.4 percent increase in February , and a 7.6 percent increase in March . Attendance at Boston area museums and attractions was down in 2012 and 2013 , but attendance and revenues in 2014 : Q1 were up 3 percent over 2013 : Q1 .

Contacts in New Hampshire and Rhode Island cite declines in sales of single family homes , while Massachusetts experienced no change , and respondents in Connecticut , Maine , and Vermont cite increases in sales relative to December 2012 . Scarce inventory is said to be the most significant constraint on the growth of sales , while uncertainty from new qualified mortgage rules and flood insurance reforms are also believed to be causing buyers to remain cautious about making offers . Contacts in Connecticut say that sales are being affected by weak consumer confidence and a shortage of stable employment opportunities . Median sale prices increased year-over-year in four of the six New England states , decreasing only in Connecticut and Vermont . In Massachusetts , particularly in the Greater Boston area , price appreciation driven by low inventory levels has become a concern as realtors caution that high prices could keep first time home buyers out of the market . Pending sales suggest the market for single family houses and condos is off to a good start in 2014 , increasing in all states except Rhode Island .

Harvesting was somewhat behind the normal pace , especially for corn , which was maturing late . Overall , yield reports suggest that the corn harvest wo n't reach last year 's record level , while the soybean harvest may surpass last year 's record . Corn prices moved up and were higher than a year ago , while soybean prices moved down and were lower than a year ago . Because of a wide range in yields and differing rental arrangements , the profitability of crop operations ranged from substantial losses to just breaking-even .

826,"One contact noted that the bankruptcy of South Korean shipping company Hanjin ( which left $ 14 billion of cargo stranded at sea due to inability to pay port fees ) should have limited effects on retail inventories . Manufacturing inventories were generally at desired levels . Steel service center inventories were below historical norms , but a contacted noted that this was likely intentional because growth in steel demand has slowed . Current capital expenditures continued to grow at a moderate pace , as did expectations for future spending . Outlays were primarily for replacing industrial and IT equipment . Hiring picked up to a moderate rate , and contacts expect hiring to continue at a moderate rate over the next six to twelve months . Many contacts noted that the labor market continues to tighten . Demand remained strong for skilled workers , particularly for many professional and technical occupations , sales , and skilled manufacturing and building trades . Contacts also indicated that competition continued to grow for lower-skilled workers . A staffing firm again reported no change in billable hours and ongoing difficulty filling orders at the wages employers were willing to pay . The firm noted that turnover rates were high . It also reported an increase in drug test failures relative to a year ago among potential employees .

Demand for electricity increased slightly in the Chicago area , led by an influx of large industrial customers , while demand for electricity fell slightly in the Detroit area .

Industry contacts said many producers will not be able to cover their production costs at the current crop price levels , and some have received calls from their lenders voicing concern . Cotton -- Texas ' top crop -- has seen prices push even lower with risks to the downside . Contacts reported that low prices and weakening demand will likely result in fewer cotton acres planted this year . Milk prices continued to drift unprofitably low , despite the supply disruption in the wake of winter storm Goliath , which killed roughly 30,000 dairy cows in West Texas and New Mexico .

The number of active oil and gas drilling rigs continued to pick up modestly across the District . Oil prices rose moderately to reach eighteen-month highs after OPEC announced a lower oil production target in late November 2016 . However , the majority of survey contacts expected actual production to exceed the target . Most firms projected U.S. oil production to be above previous forecasts due to continued expectations of higher oil prices . Natural gas prices were slightly higher due to strong seasonal demand . Local firms expected natural gas prices to be near current levels through 2017 , but not high enough to substantially increase drilling activity . Agriculture Farm income expectations weakened slightly as most agricultural commodity prices remained lower than a year ago . In the livestock sector , cattle prices declined from the previous year due to growing inventories , and hog prices also remained lower than year-ago levels . In the crop sector , large corn and wheat inventories kept prices subdued , but strong yields in some areas helped to offset losses from low prices . However , strong export demand boosted soybean prices moderately from a year ago . With the exception of soybeans , livestock and crop prices remained below the cost of production for some producers .

In Michigan 's Upper Peninsula , construction workers were seeing 3 percent to 4 percent wage increases . A distribution center in southern Minnesota was hiring again and raised starting wages to $ 17.50 per hour , the third consecutive annual rise in starting wages , according to a local contact .

In general , contacts were increasing capital expenditures , although only one reported a major increase in spending ( to build a new plant in New Hampshire ) .

Staffing Services New England staffing firms have seen mostly negative results over the last quarter of 2017 and the start of 2018 , with the majority reporting revenue declines year-over-year . For most respondents , this reflects a low unemployment environment that has slowed hiring volumes and increased competition for the remaining labor supply . Some also remarked on the entry of new tech firms specializing in job posting sites , which has made it easier for companies to host job searches without using intermediaries . This has sparked experimentation as they look for ways to distinguish themselves through advertising , branding , improving online reviews , and increased attention to building relationships with potential talent . One respondent reported the temporary placement side of their business was the strongest , while most noted that few workers want temporary positions in the current labor market .

According to one contact , clients are hiring faster now compared with a few years ago when they were indecisive about whether to hire and whom . Prices While reports of rising prices are becoming more widespread , on balance , price increases remained modest . Among nonmanufacturing firms , one-third reported increases for prices paid , and less than one-fourth reported increases for prices received – about the same as the prior period . Reports of price increases were more widespread among manufacturing firms this period , with over half noting higher prices paid and over one-third indicating higher prices received for their own goods . Builders continued to report rising prices , particularly for materials containing lumber , steel , and oil derivatives . Several manufacturers ( and their bankers ) cited rising prices for aluminum ingot , steel , and oil – some passed along the costs ; however , margins shrank for others .

885,"good . Advance bookings for 2019 were strong . Contacts noted that demand for hotel rooms continued to be robust even though the window for bookings has become shorter as a result of the increased usage of smartphone travel apps where travelers can take advantage of lower room rates for last minute travel plans . On balance , business sentiment among travel and hospitality contacts is cautiously optimistic for 2019 . Construction and Real Estate Reports from District brokers and homebuilders came in slightly more optimistic than the previous report as activity moved into the early stages of the spring selling season . The recent moderation in mortgage rates was cited as helping to alleviate some of the pressure on housing affordability in the District . Though still flat or down from a year ago , existing home sales in many markets across the District improved at the start of 2019 from lows experienced at the close of 2018 . Inventory levels , albeit increasing on a year-over-year basis , remained low in most markets . Home price appreciation continued to moderate as weaker year-over-year sales and slightly rising inventory levels created less upward pressure on prices .

For firms that produce components , the costs of `` qualifying '' new suppliers usually exceed the benefits . Indirect costs of the tariffs were also significant . For example , one contact complained about having to hire consultants to change computer systems to track the cost of tariffs . Contacts said the US tariffs and foreign retaliation had weakened demand for their products . Firms that supply electronic components to capital goods manufacturers said investment demand had slowed because firms were delaying capital expenditure plans . One contact said the brief threat to impose 5 percent tariffs on Mexican goods significantly increased uncertainty because it meant that even with an agreement in place , new tariffs were still possible . In general , contacts said they were able to pass the tariff costs onto their customers . One contact reported that previous problems finding trucking capacity had ebbed . Five of seven contacts reported flat or reduced employment . A frozen fish manufacturer said it was unable to find workers . A manufacturer of electronic components said it had laid people off as a result of the tariffs , with headcount declining by about 10 percent .

For example , the firm had moved an assembly line from the U.S. to Germany because most of the components in the product came from China and making the product in Germany",-0.75,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:37:10.1569262Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": -0.75\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 9812, 261, 21544, 1919, 12212, 9667, 322, 6133, 25812, 304, 11302, 8898, 869, 22387, 29879, 1497, 372, 471, 12234, 2898, 470, 9301, 304, 652, 1765, 304, 1661, 29899, 1451, 8233, 1462, 27801, 869, 1152, 13734, 1516, 393, 7738, 7117, 1919, 278, 21544, 310, 4954, 4021, 9215, 6629, 716, 1462, 27801, 5491, 13461, 278, 23633, 869, 1894, 1088, 21544, 310, 278, 9913, 28324, 892, 884, 7282, 869, 1152, 1342, 1919, 697, 6958, 15313, 1312, 1048, 2534, 304, 298, 533, 8799, 1934, 304, 1735, 6601, 6757, 304, 5702, 278, 3438, 310, 9913, 28324, 869, 22387, 29879, 1497, 278, 3148, 9913, 28324, 322, 9117, 3240, 2606, 362, 750, 8062, 6419, 9667, 363, 1009, 9316, 869, 14152, 1516, 393, 11421, 27758, 7117, 304, 7483, 22535, 12012, 332, 414, 1497, 13258, 358, 9667, 750, 5232, 287, 1363, 13734, 1516, 892, 9055, 292, 7483, 1518, 355, 17252, 13900, 869, 3118, 6958, 1497, 278, 11473, 28469, 304, 2411, 852, 29871, 29945, 10151, 9913, 28324, 373, 24777, 22535, 16951, 11664, 25812, 1363, 372, 6839, 393, 1584, 411, 385, 17327, 297, 2058, 1919, 716, 9913, 28324, 892, 1603, 1950, 869, 512, 2498, 1919, 25957, 1497, 896, 892, 2221, 304, 1209, 278, 9913, 2593, 21544, 11480, 1009, 20330, 869, 3118, 6958, 8967, 393, 3517, 4828, 9138, 534, 2707, 292, 13284, 750, 321, 1327, 287, 869, 22853, 310, 9881, 25957, 8967, 12151, 470, 12212, 5703, 358, 869, 319, 14671, 2256, 9427, 12012, 9945, 1497, 372, 471, 9368, 304, 1284, 17162, 869, 319, 12012, 9945, 310, 27758, 7117, 1497, 372, 750, 12341, 2305, 1283, 408, 263, 1121, 310, 278, 9913, 28324, 1919, 411, 2343, 2798, 4845, 2827, 491, 1048, 29871, 29896, 29900, 10151, 869, 13, 13, 2831, 1342, 1919, 278, 9226, 750, 6153, 385, 11470, 1196, 515, 278, 501, 29889, 29903, 29889, 304, 9556, 1363, 1556, 310, 278, 7117, 297, 278, 3234, 2996, 515, 7551, 322, 3907, 278, 3234, 297, 9556, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29908, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29955, 29945, 13, 29913], 'total_duration': 831017600, 'load_duration': 6359200, 'prompt_eval_count': 360, 'prompt_eval_duration': 351575000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 472802000}",-0.6,-0.6,-0.7,-0.75,-0.8

Looking ahead , professional & business service firms expressed mild optimism about prospects for the months ahead , whereas leisure & hospitality firms expressed increased concern that conditions would deteriorate . Tourism , which had picked up somewhat in the previous reporting period , has more recently shown signs of weakening . A number of contacts attribute this to the recent wave of the pandemic across the nation and much of the world , as well as the onset of cold weather , which limits outdoor activities . An authority on New York City 's tourism sector noted that most recent visitations have been short haul trips . Hotel occupancy rates have been noticeably higher on weekends than weekdays but are still well below 50 percent , and room rates are down sharply . Many city hotels are picking up some of the slack with alternative uses , such as providing shelter for the homeless . Advance bookings for the holiday season suggest only a modest uptick . While tourism is expected to rebound noticeably in 2021 , it is projected to remain 25-30 percent below pre-pandemic levels , as the international and business segments are expected to lag . Real Estate and Construction Housing markets have continued to strengthen across much of the District . In both upstate New York and the areas around New York City , sales activity has been brisk , home prices have risen strongly , and the inventory of unsold homes has declined further .

919,"September 2 , 2020 Summary of Economic Activity Third District business activity changed little overall during the current Beige Book period and remained far below levels observed prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic . Business operations increased incrementally , as COVID-19 caseloads remained at relatively low levels throughout the period . As firms recalled more of their workforce , net employment also grew modestly ; however , firms also continued to issue permanent layoffs . Some wage increases were noted among lower-paying jobs . Meanwhile , contacts reported ongoing difficulties attracting workers . Prices edged higher again amid continued spotty price spikes . Firms maintained modestly positive expectations for growth over the next six months ; however , uncertainty is extremely high , as contacts worried about the end of stimulus measures , pending layoffs , and an inevitable rise of evictions , foreclosures , and bankruptcies . Looming over all is the active presence of the coronavirus . Employment and Wages Employment increased modestly overall as firms stepped up hiring and recalling workers ; however , layoffs continued as well . Among firms in our COVID-19 survey , 25 percent reported that they had hired new workers in July , and 13 percent recalled furloughed workers . Meanwhile , about 6 percent of the firms had laid off workers permanently , and another 6 percent had furloughed workers .

However , at mid-August , a slightly greater percentage of firms reported that employment had declined over the month than had increased .

On the supply side , some producers in Idaho and Arizona have reduced live animal herd sizes in response to bottlenecks at meat processing plants . Agricultural export markets were similarly downbeat . Milk exports declined notably . Slowdowns in the entertainment and restaurant sectors abroad hit exports of nuts and raisins . Energy producers saw steep declines in industrial and commercial demand , but rapid increases in residential usage . Timber loggers witnessed some additional demand from Asian markets facing reduced supply from other western countries . Real Estate and Construction Residential construction activity was mixed on net . After a temporary halt in construction , residential projects restarted in some areas in late April or early May , depending on local social distancing relaxation schedules . Overall , home sales slowed dramatically and inventories decreased as sellers held back amid in-person home tour restrictions . Nonetheless , a few local markets in California and Idaho continued to see strong home sales , especially within higher price ranges . Uncertainty around future construction and sales remained high .

Asset quality remained healthy without notable increases to nonperforming loans or charge-offs . Energy Energy industry contacts reported damage to infrastructure servicing production in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of Hurricane Ida . However , some indicated that resiliency efforts made since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , including the hardening of energy infrastructure and investments in diesel-driven power generation , accelerated the recovery . Reduced oil and gas output was primarily attributed to challenges in redeploying workers since reentry into some communities was difficult or impossible after the storm . However , collaboration with private entities and state government helped alleviate immediate post-hurricane labor tightness . Some contacts expressed concern about short-term natural gas supply and pricing pressures resulting from reduced output . Further , reduced investment in oil and gas exploration and production in recent months is anticipated to result in long-term cutbacks in supply .

926,"March 3 , 2021 Summary of Economic Activity The District 's economy regained momentum after it had slowed in the previous reporting period . Customer demand in the current period proved to be better than what contacts had expected , reflecting declining numbers of coronavirus infections and various fiscal relief measures . That said , activity remains below prepandemic levels for most firms . In addition , many firms , particularly those in construction , retail , and manufacturing , reported that delayed deliveries from suppliers and coronavirus-related employee outages constrained their output . Hiring activity was modest , even though customer demand improved , and wage pressures increased moderately .

933,"March 3 , 2021 Summary of Economic Activity On balance , business activity in the Third District rebounded to a modest pace of growth during the current Beige Book period – the first significant growth since midsummer . However , activity in most sectors remained below levels observed prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic . Net employment appeared to rise slightly after falling slightly in the prior period . Positive wage and price growth trends increased to modest and moderate paces , respectively . Economic gains appeared to reflect waning COVID-19 cases and the relaxation of some business restrictions . However , firms continued to cite disruptions at production sites , consumer outlets , and along supply chains . Moreover , wintry weather conditions have constrained growth in several sectors . More than half of the firms expressed positive expectations for modest growth over the next six months – the percent broadened further among nonmanufacturing firms but narrowed among manufacturers . Employment and Wages Employment appeared to increase slightly overall – rebounding from a slight decrease in the prior period . The share of nonmanufacturing firms reporting employment increases for full-time employees just edged out those reporting decreases . Among the manufacturers , employment increases broadened to nearly one-third of the reporting firms , while reported job declines waned . Moreover , average hours worked rose for a larger share of all firms .

Staffing firm contacts reported that strong demand continued for new orders , while qualified job candidates remained a challenge to",0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T19:37:46.4776925Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 29924, 1279, 29871, 29941, 1919, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29906, 29896, 6991, 5219, 310, 12884, 293, 13414, 1551, 17346, 1919, 5381, 6354, 297, 278, 18008, 7457, 15121, 7261, 304, 263, 878, 342, 27725, 310, 14321, 2645, 278, 1857, 1522, 2231, 6726, 3785, 785, 278, 937, 7282, 14321, 1951, 7145, 2083, 1050, 869, 2398, 1919, 6354, 297, 1556, 409, 14359, 9488, 2400, 11174, 8900, 7536, 304, 278, 373, 842, 310, 278, 19937, 29899, 29896, 29929, 7243, 24552, 869, 12670, 5703, 358, 7470, 304, 14451, 10029, 1156, 20327, 10029, 297, 278, 7536, 3785, 869, 10321, 3321, 281, 482, 322, 8666, 14321, 534, 1975, 11664, 304, 878, 342, 322, 17768, 403, 282, 3302, 1919, 8307, 869, 12884, 293, 330, 2708, 7470, 304, 9432, 281, 273, 292, 19937, 29899, 29896, 29929, 4251, 322, 278, 26681, 362, 310, 777, 5381, 25091, 869, 2398, 1919, 13734, 1516, 7572, 304, 274, 568, 766, 582, 1980, 472, 5802, 11840, 1919, 21691, 714, 10376, 1919, 322, 3412, 11421, 521, 2708, 869, 12808, 1919, 5401, 2202, 14826, 5855, 505, 1040, 22042, 14321, 297, 3196, 409, 14359, 869, 5853, 1135, 4203, 310, 278, 13734, 1516, 13384, 6374, 2149, 800, 363, 878, 342, 14321, 975, 278, 2446, 4832, 7378, 785, 278, 10151, 2545, 4858, 287, 4340, 4249, 1661, 1171, 9765, 3864, 13734, 1516, 541, 12474, 287, 4249, 12012, 332, 414, 869, 7361, 22812, 322, 399, 1179, 7361, 22812, 7470, 304, 7910, 10029, 12463, 785, 337, 9917, 292, 515, 263, 7248, 23806, 297, 278, 7536, 3785, 869, 450, 6232, 310, 1661, 1171, 9765, 3864, 13734, 1516, 23415, 5703, 358, 16415, 363, 2989, 29899, 2230, 22873, 925, 1226, 3192, 714, 1906, 23415, 9263, 2129, 869, 17302, 278, 12012, 332, 414, 1919, 5703, 358, 16415, 2545, 4858, 287, 304, 8886, 697, 29899, 22585, 310, 278, 23415, 13734, 1516, 1919, 1550, 8967, 4982, 4845, 1475, 281, 273, 287, 869, 12808, 1919, 6588, 6199, 3796, 11492, 363, 263, 7200, 6232, 310, 599, 13734, 1516, 869, 13, 13, 855, 3470, 292, 9226, 25957, 8967, 393, 4549, 9667, 7572, 363, 716, 11299, 1919, 1550, 18698, 4982, 21669, 9488, 263, 18766, 304, 32007, 32001, 8853, 18616, 2073, 1115, 29871, 29900, 29889, 29941, 29913], 'total_duration': 693487500, 'prompt_eval_count': 392, 'prompt_eval_duration': 364854000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 323270000}",0.4,0.4,0.3,0.75,0.3

A wood products provider mentioned that sales at retail home centers were well above pre-pandemic levels . Sales of vehicles continued to be hindered by semiconductor shortages and other ongoing disruptions to inventory building . Activity in the consumer and business services sectors rose slightly .

Business travel , relative to leisure travel , has been slower to recover from recent lows . Some contacts in the hospitality sector noted higher revenues despite lower occupancy rates , which was attributed to price effects . Demand for transportation services remained elevated but supply was constrained somewhat by labor shortages and other capacity-reducing factors .

Demand for non-COVID-related health-care services rose quickly of late , while inventories for medical supplies were tighter .

Manufacturers reported a modest increase in new orders , but shipments declined slightly as production was impacted by weather , long lead times for inputs , truck and container shortages , and an increase in employee absenteeism due in part to the Omicron variant . Ports and trucking companies continued to report strong volumes but challenges meeting it because of shortages of truck drivers and transportation equipment . Retailers saw moderate growth in sales and foot traffic in recent weeks . Travel and tourism , on the other hand , declined slightly due to winter weather and the recent surge in covid cases . Residential real estate markets were little changed as demand remained strong but low inventory levels persisted . Meanwhile , commercial real estate activity picked up moderately . Industrial real estate remained the hottest sector , but sales and leasing of multifamily and office properties grew strongly this period . Bankers reported rising loan demand across all loan types , although auto and mortgage lending was constrained by the inventory shortages in those markets . Nonfinancial firms reported a modest increase in revenues but continued to struggle hiring enough workers to meet demand .

While some southeastern ports reported that breakbulk cargo volumes rose as shippers sought alternative ways to move cargo amid supply chain disruptions , container traffic decreased and was characterized as a return to more sustainable growth . Trucking tonnage also fell , and housing-related freight was noted as particularly weak . Railroads experienced declines in intermodal shipments of packaging materials , chemicals , and metals . Logistics firms involved in moving and relocation , `` big and bulky '' delivery services , and warehousing saw year-over-year volume declines as consumer and housing demand softened and firms reduced inventory levels . Most transportation contacts expect additional weakening of demand in 2023 .

Discretionary and more interest rate sensitive consumption categories – such as travel and car purchases – declined at a rapid pace , while spending on non-discretionary consumption categories – such as food , energy , and healthcare – increased modestly . Community Conditions Low to moderate income ( LMI ) households in the Tenth District reported greater difficulty securing adequate childcare over the past few months . Contacts cited both a lack of availability and rising costs at childcare facilities as the major barriers faced by households seeking care . Insufficient childcare availability and unaffordability continued to hinder workforce participation among LMI households . Recent policy efforts to improve childcare availability – for example , a recent zoning reform in Wichita , Kansas increased maximum home daycare capacity from 10 to 12 children – have reportedly been more than offset by an acceleration of closures of childcare facilities . Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Manufacturing businesses reported that overall activity remained mostly unchanged over the past few weeks .

Furthermore , multiple contacts noted they focused on lending to existing customers and became more prudent in lending to new customers . Real Estate and Construction Homebuilders reported steady sales following an unexpected uptick in the prior period . Contacts continued to attribute the recent improvement to incentives , discounts on older inventory , and new homes built with smaller footprints and lower-cost features . Existing home sales fell slightly from already low levels in most markets – following a moderate decline in the prior period . Contacts noted that the lack of new listings and the continued decline in housing affordability meant the normally busy spring housing market may fail to materialize . Requests for assistance with housing and utility bills fell but continued to dominate the share of 211 requests in New Jersey and Pennsylvania . Almost 32 percent of all requests in the two states were related to housing , while 27 percent of the requests regarded utility bills .

For example , a gaskets manufacturer was `` hunkering down '' and halted hiring and capital expenditures due to fears of a potential economic downturn . A plastics coater reported smaller orders because customers had less money due to increased food and energy costs . Ports and Transportation Demand was weak at Fifth District ports this period due to less than the usual seasonal rebound in volume ; imports were lower year-over-year and month-over-month . The decline in import volume was mainly due less consumer goods coming into the port . Exports were flat this period . Spot shipping rates have continued to decline and carriers were doing more blank sailings in recent weeks to limit capacity . Empties were still moving and containers were flowing smoothly at the ports ; turn times were good and container dwell times had returned to normal . Demand for airfreight was soft this period ; there was an especially sharp decline in international airfreight , both in terms of exports and imports .

Banking and Finance Loan demand continued to modestly soften across all loan types , with residential mortgage lending seeing the biggest slowdown in demand . Respondents were generally in agreement that the higher rate environment and continued economic uncertainty were the primary drivers in this continued downward trend . One institution noted customers were `` sitting on the sidelines '' waiting for more clarity regarding rates and the economy . Deposit balances remained flat with still a great deal of competition for any available funds being shopped amongst institutions . Loan delinquency rates and credit quality metrics remained stable with no movement up or down . Nonfinancial Services Nonfinancial service providers continued to report that demand for their services and overall revenues remained stable . One firm noted they saw more of their clients comparing prices when shopping for their services and were entertaining more offers from competitors . This level of competition put pressure on pricing and maintaining current clients . Wages and workforce availability continued to be a challenge with low unemployment rates and employees continuing to ask for wage increases .

Uncertainty was still a theme with both the firms surveyed and their clients , which made the industry as whole quite cautious going into the new year .

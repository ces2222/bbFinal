1,"June 17 , 1970 Summary of Findings Sixth District directors have mixed opinions about future business conditions . If any consensus exists , it is that the economy has not yet bottomed out and that recovery will be less than spectacular when it comes . According to directors ' reports and other sources of information , further weakening in sales , employment and production is likely . Department stores report lower volume and growing resistance to higher priced merchandise . Belt tightening by businesses has spread , and directors report many instances of slowdowns in capital spending . Employment and production cutbacks are common .

Regarding auto sales , distributors contacted report some shifting from larger cars to the compact sized , loaded with optional equipment . Rather than settling for a stripped-down version of a full-sized car , customers are purchasing lower priced equipment-packed models .

2,"of jewelry manufacturers in southern Massachusetts and northern Rhode Island report that 1970 sales levels to date are brisk . The textile industry , concentrated in the same area , has experienced a dramatic increase in demand for products associated with home sewing , reflecting the heightened consumer cost consciousness noted elsewhere this year . The New England machine tool industry , on the other hand , continues in a severely depressed situation with no letup in sight . Several regional producers of chemical and mineral inputs into housing associated products ( e.g. , paints , carpets , linoleum , etc . ) now discern a turnaround in demand as having occurred four to eight weeks ago . Regional labor markets , as noted in earlier reports , are softer than they have been for some years . This easing apparently extends into both blue- and white-collar groups . The views of our academic consultants have perhaps converged same since earlier in the summer . Professor Paul Samuelson feels certain that the economic turnaround is behind us , and that the slowdown has been sufficiently mild that it will escape official NBER designation as a recession . '' As a weak contraction tends to be followed by a sluggish expansion , Samuelson expressed concern that the existent real GNP gap will widen further over the next four quarters .

Since a growth in real output of about 4 percent is necessary to avoid this , he concludes that authorities should permit a monetary expansion great enough",0.3,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:27:19.1910498Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 1009, 25528, 19245, 297, 12227, 16255, 304, 12727, 10282, 573, 7633, 2264, 369, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28734, 6292, 6157, 298, 3608, 460, 1170, 2606, 842, 415, 2245, 546, 4779, 1200, 25088, 297, 272, 1348, 2698, 1200, 659, 8304, 264, 17296, 5247, 297, 5637, 354, 4076, 5363, 395, 1611, 427, 9988, 1200, 7967, 288, 272, 5110, 2106, 12077, 2434, 16508, 8659, 14816, 456, 879, 842, 415, 1450, 5783, 5599, 3921, 4779, 1200, 356, 272, 799, 1021, 1200, 10352, 297, 264, 28064, 27696, 4620, 395, 708, 1346, 715, 297, 7739, 842, 15223, 11908, 22862, 302, 10845, 304, 25837, 14391, 778, 11821, 5363, 4076, 325, 317, 28723, 28721, 28723, 1200, 3358, 1074, 1200, 1253, 28720, 1468, 1200, 12893, 1254, 383, 1200, 4345, 842, 1143, 1055, 2312, 1173, 264, 1527, 20886, 297, 5637, 390, 2461, 9894, 2308, 298, 5435, 4587, 3584, 842, 18718, 7579, 11574, 1200, 390, 8659, 297, 5585, 7959, 1200, 460, 579, 810, 821, 590, 506, 750, 354, 741, 1267, 842, 851, 1897, 288, 10596, 4976, 778, 1560, 5045, 28733, 304, 3075, 28733, 10921, 283, 4938, 842, 415, 8044, 302, 813, 11860, 7731, 1549, 506, 5230, 9105, 2560, 1348, 1854, 5585, 297, 272, 5561, 842, 11962, 3920, 4157, 28718, 14814, 8315, 2552, 369, 272, 6638, 1527, 20886, 349, 2910, 592, 1200, 304, 369, 272, 3944, 3254, 659, 750, 20554, 16583, 369, 378, 622, 8957, 5189, 418, 16819, 2621, 352, 390, 264, 937, 1893, 842, 9842, 1136, 264, 6334, 4188, 1774, 21747, 298, 347, 4961, 486, 264, 1135, 23065, 789, 11120, 1200, 4157, 28718, 14814, 11558, 4368, 369, 272, 2588, 308, 1353, 420, 24257, 10467, 622, 275, 6667, 3629, 754, 272, 1679, 2308, 22142, 842, 13, 13, 24091, 264, 6057, 297, 1353, 3825, 302, 684, 28705, 28781, 4153, 349, 4892, 298, 4461, 456, 1200, 400, 5233, 5887, 369, 12503, 1023, 12748, 264, 1326, 23101, 11120, 1598, 2066, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28770, 28752], 'total_duration': 2586227000, 'load_duration': 7710500, 'prompt_eval_count': 370, 'prompt_eval_duration': 993984000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1582246000}"

4,"over the slowness of payments on receivables by business creditors , but it is generally recognized that , in most cases , the situation reflects the high cost of funds and restricted liquidity , rather than actual distress . Price increases for durable goods continue to be about as numerous as in recent months , and there is no clear evidence of a diminution of the rate of rise of prices of finished goods . Rising costs and unsatisfactory volume are causing transportation firms to push regulatory authorities for appreciable increases in rates in hopes of improving earnings . Job markets continue to soften as indicated by unemployment compensation claims , and reports of restricted hiring practices . Increasingly , skilled workers such as machinists , teachers , and other professional types are listed among those seeking work . Lists of unfilled job openings are the smallest since the early Sixties . Despite the improved labor supply picture , wage and pension demands continue large and are backed by militant worker organizations in state and local governments as well as in factories , utilities , and transportation companies . Local strikes are frequent and prolonged .

Many businesses are pushing cost-cutting programs through reductions of staff ; lower outlays for advertising , public relations , entertainment , and other items not directly related to production ; inventory curtailments ; and postponements of short lead-time capital expenditures . The truck strike continues to be a very significant depressing force on output and retail trade in the Chicago area . The embargo on truck shipments of components and finished goods to and from the Chicago area , of course , continues to hamper output in other parts of the country . The impact of the strike is said to be especially hard on smaller manufacturers and retailers who are less able to utilize alternative arrangements for moving goods . The rise in policy loans at life insurance companies has moderated in the past month from the extremely high levels noted in the first third of the year . Life insurance companies would like to improve their liquidity and are not seeking new long-term investment outlets .

6,"July 15 , 1970 Economic activity in the Fourth District improved in June , partly reflecting the termination of major strikes . The results of our most recent survey of manufacturers indicate that a more than usual seasonal decline in business conditions may develop in July in the district , although the bunching of plant-wide shutdowns for vacations at this time of year makes the data unusually difficult to interpret . Our directors remain generally pessimistic about the near-term economic outlook , although some of the industrialists feel that economic conditions may be a little better now than in previous months . In response to our question about price developments , we received a few reports of price discounting , but the consensus of our directors and a limited sample of business economists in the district was that prices will remain firm because of strong upward wage pressures . The improvement in economic conditions in the district in June was largely the result of the resumption of production and shipments following work stoppages in the area . The seasonally adjusted rate of insured unemployment for the district declined in June , and at month-end was approximately halfway between the pre-trucking strike level of March and the peak reached in mid-May . Steel ingot production in the district recovered in June after having declined in April and May .

In comparison with the 1969 holiday season , the majority of retailers reported that they expect a heavier volume of sales this year . Three of the retailers expected a substantially heavier volume , eleven expected a slightly heavier volume , seven expected sales to be about the same as in the 1969 season , while only three felt sales might be slightly lighter this year . In the way of general comments , one retailer noted that consumer sentiment was low due to the economic situation but expected relief during the fourth quarter and early in 1971 . One noted that if the General Motors strike continued , plus the massive layoffs at Texas Instruments , Ling-Temco-Vought , General Dynamics and Ford , that holiday sales could be softer than are now anticipated . One retailer indicated he was taking a `` lean bull '' position and expected October through April to be very strong for retail sales .",0.5,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:27:31.3295881Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.5}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 1478, 286, 28733, 6628, 404, 460, 1215, 5635, 302, 4144, 8995, 438, 456, 727, 842, 560, 10367, 395, 272, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28784, 28774, 12010, 3302, 1200, 272, 7757, 302, 11603, 404, 5745, 369, 590, 1675, 264, 9425, 749, 7531, 302, 6292, 456, 879, 842, 9673, 302, 272, 11603, 404, 3349, 264, 10883, 1929, 9425, 749, 7531, 1200, 19806, 3349, 264, 7191, 9425, 749, 7531, 1200, 6671, 3349, 6292, 298, 347, 684, 272, 1348, 390, 297, 272, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28784, 28774, 3302, 1200, 1312, 865, 1712, 2770, 6292, 1659, 347, 7191, 23645, 456, 879, 842, 560, 272, 1069, 302, 2952, 7616, 1200, 624, 11603, 263, 8659, 369, 12077, 21790, 403, 2859, 2940, 298, 272, 6638, 4620, 562, 3349, 10853, 1938, 272, 10036, 8249, 304, 2935, 297, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28740, 842, 2387, 8659, 369, 513, 272, 3592, 8854, 734, 12104, 5317, 1200, 3285, 272, 9130, 4897, 14567, 438, 7826, 560, 1042, 3105, 1200, 393, 288, 28733, 28738, 366, 1115, 28733, 28790, 1322, 1200, 3592, 384, 25705, 304, 12101, 1200, 369, 12010, 6292, 829, 347, 579, 810, 821, 460, 1055, 25024, 842, 2387, 11603, 263, 14075, 400, 403, 3344, 264, 5008, 6115, 10386, 9842, 2840, 304, 3349, 4527, 1059, 3999, 298, 347, 1215, 2967, 354, 11603, 6292, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28782, 28752], 'total_duration': 2356714200, 'load_duration': 6694900, 'prompt_eval_count': 274, 'prompt_eval_duration': 812550000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1535275000}"
8,"October 14 , 1970 There is evidence that future growth in large CD 's at Tenth District banks will be less . There are indications also that business loan demand may be easing slightly . The labor situation in the Kansas City area has worsened as the construction strike—now in its seventh month—continues and the General Motors strike prevails at several large GM assembly plants . The reduction in output of feed grains and high feed-grain prices is likely to have an impact on the WPI and CPI within several months . Instead of providing a downward pressure on these indices which occurred from March to August , farm prices may again exert upward pressure later this year or early next year . Those large District banks which have actively sought large CD 's ( many have not ) have continued to attract substantial amounts of funds . Growth rates of outstanding CD 's have been comparable to those at large banks in New York City and Chicago . One peculiarity in the Tenth District has been that a significant amount of CD funds have come from state and local governmental units—about one-third of the total growth in CD 's . This source of funds would seem to be limited , so that future growth of CD 's may slow . Despite the rapid growth of CD ' s , most of the District banks so far have retained bank-affiliate commercial paper as a source of funds .

9,"be delivered on the east coast at substantially lower prices than could domestic crude . This price differential discouraged domestic exploration for oil . With the recent difficulties in the mid-east , tanker rates have increased by as much as 300 per cent , and imported crude now sells at about 75 cents per barrel above domestic crude on the east coast . Thus , domestic crude prices are under pressure , and at least one oil company has announced price increases in the Tenth District . Business is slow for District farm implement dealers . Inventories are relatively large , and cases of price cutting are not uncommon . Collections on credit sales are reported to be noticeably slower than last year . The interrelatedness of Tenth District economic activity with both national and international business conditions is illustrated by the experience of a Kansas City manufacturer of bottling and automatic vending equipment . This firm 's total business is about unchanged from a year ago , with increasing international business about offsetting a definite decline in domestic sales . The decline in domestic sales is attributed to reduced overtime and lower employment in factories with vending machines , as vending machine operators drop routes and defer the purchase of new equipment . There is some concern within the firm that their growing international business will be hurt by retaliations against U. S. restrictions on imports .

If his expectation is borne out , GM dealers in the District will probably run short of parts and new autos , as inventory shortages are already becoming apparent . The Northwest Airlines strike is also having scattered effects throughout the District . A few firms servicing Northwest Airlines have furloughed employees , and a number of retail establishments have experienced noticeable sales reductions . In addition , Northwest Airlines has cut their flight schedules because of the strike , and as a result landing fees to a number of airports in the District have been drastically reduced . These landing fees are important contributions to airport sinking funds , and in at least one case so far , these reductions have become especially troublesome . Ninth District bankers are still experiencing strong demands for loanable funds , according to information gathered during go-around sessions with both directors and officers of this bank . The continued strong loan demand seems to be general throughout the District as no one cited a case where loan demand had diminished . On the contrary , numerous instances were cited where demand had actually strengthened and non-financial businesses had taken further steps to economize on the use of funds .

Most directors and other business leaders were less than enthusiastic over the use of wage and price controls . However , several were relatively open minded toward this approach , while many of the respondents felt additional action on the part of the Administration to limit further wage and price increases was needed . The Chairman of the electrical equipment manufacturer reported that the Business Council , which he headed until recently , had made it clear to President Nixon that Council Members do n't want wage and price controls because they are convinced they will never work . One director , however , commented that the time was approaching when wage and price controls must be adopted , and another director felt that , while controls would not be workable over any extended period , such controls might have a useful psychological effect for a short period .

The one exception to this general experience is in boating , where dealers are expecting a tremendous boat year in 1972 and are ordering accordingly . These orders are , however , based on expectations , not actual sales experience . Capital goods producers described business as sluggish in all lines except office and public construction . In some cases directors noted a recent deterioration in orders . One director said that he had just become aware that in the container machinery field , customers were cutting back their capital budgets . Another director felt that the recent downturn in capital goods orders was a result of uncertainties about investment tax credit . Sales of intermediate products to the industrial sector were variously described as sluggish to poor , especially among suppliers to the aerospace and chemical industries . Only one director mentioned that one of his plants was continuing to decrease employment .

One director noted less foreign competition in the construction material market , in part due to the surcharge , in part to a new buy-American feeling inspired by the President",0.5,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:27:56.7004844Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.5}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 28759, 4208, 28705, 28740, 28734, 1200, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28740, 3489, 22650, 11634, 369, 652, 12077, 1955, 349, 15317, 298, 4916, 11323, 1999, 1200, 304, 297, 264, 1664, 4715, 23966, 346, 1200, 1312, 652, 5565, 11282, 1955, 349, 1309, 3448, 1135, 23065, 789, 842, 3635, 302, 813, 22650, 8304, 4337, 25911, 883, 8506, 477, 652, 24295, 842, 7404, 3080, 477, 272, 6292, 9021, 302, 813, 22650, 464, 18253, 12077, 9981, 349, 11323, 1999, 1873, 1200, 562, 736, 349, 708, 5566, 302, 264, 9737, 668, 688, 842, 415, 624, 5851, 298, 456, 2952, 2659, 349, 297, 1359, 1077, 1200, 970, 3215, 404, 460, 15550, 264, 23943, 9088, 879, 297, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28750, 304, 460, 19815, 25485, 842, 2957, 8636, 460, 1200, 3545, 1200, 2818, 356, 13879, 1200, 459, 4695, 6292, 2659, 842, 17053, 11282, 22862, 5397, 1955, 390, 1135, 23065, 789, 297, 544, 4715, 3741, 4007, 304, 798, 6380, 842, 560, 741, 4469, 22650, 8659, 264, 5391, 19211, 1782, 352, 297, 8636, 842, 2387, 6859, 773, 369, 400, 553, 776, 2727, 5635, 369, 297, 272, 7640, 26514, 1834, 1200, 5688, 654, 12164, 852, 652, 5565, 8326, 28713, 842, 6880, 6859, 2770, 369, 272, 5391, 15129, 453, 297, 5565, 11282, 8636, 403, 264, 1204, 302, 521, 8422, 1690, 497, 684, 8542, 3947, 6183, 842, 16377, 302, 22602, 4076, 298, 272, 10663, 9642, 654, 4118, 346, 5397, 390, 1135, 23065, 789, 298, 5366, 1200, 4012, 3352, 24295, 298, 272, 264, 10667, 2644, 304, 10845, 17909, 842, 6352, 624, 6859, 7083, 369, 624, 302, 516, 9923, 403, 15317, 298, 17889, 14087, 842, 13, 13, 6167, 6859, 8659, 2108, 7223, 8995, 297, 272, 6380, 3388, 2668, 1200, 297, 744, 2940, 298, 272, 1147, 14978, 1200, 297, 744, 298, 264, 633, 3848, 28733, 12188, 4622, 11971, 486, 272, 5120, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28782, 28752], 'total_duration': 2544253600, 'load_duration': 5239700, 'prompt_eval_count': 361, 'prompt_eval_duration': 972281000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1563665000}"

19,"As for the present outlook for prices , about two-thirds of the directors expect that moderate increases will occur , and the balance anticipate that prices will remain essentially unchanged . Until the Phase II program was made public , about one-fourth of the directors were expecting substantial increases in prices , half were anticipating moderate increases , and the rest were looking for little change . Thus , the consensus of directors , by a small majority , is that the creation of the Pay and Price Boards enhances the prospect for greater price stability . The outlook for the regional economy was also largely unchanged by announcement of the Phase II outline . Eighteen of the directors currently foresee a moderate increase in activity in their local areas , as compared with 14 earlier . The announcement caused no alteration in the directors ' assessment of the prospects for the unemployment rate in their local areas . Just over half were ( and still are ) anticipating a moderate decline in the unemployment rate . The directors believe that prices will edge upward slightly in the district . Earlier , directors were somewhat less optimistic about prices .

Since retail sales are so important at this time of year and consumer spending is being closely watched as a clue to economic growth in 1971 , district retail stores were again surveyed this month . Reports were mixed—with some department stores and discount houses reporting a decline in sales during December , as compared with the same month last year ; while others reported gains , mostly of a modest nature . After having generally good sales in November , several stores reported that sales in early December were disappointing but then improved substantially again just before Christmas . Weather conditions may have been partly responsible for this pattern . Generally , stores that had the best gains were the large combination mail order-department stores . One regional controller of a chain of such stores said that their sales usually hold up quite well during economic slowdowns when customers are interested in good quality at reasonable prices . Somewhat surprisingly , a large store that specializes in luxury gift items and caters to above-average income customers reported sales this fall increased by about 10 per cent . Generally , stores that had strong sales just before Christmas also report strong post-Christmas sales , while stores with weak pre-Christmas sales continue to exhibit weak sales .

22,"December 8 , 1971 Uncertainty over Phase II has not affected the pace of business activity in the District , and businessmen have not let the uncertainty interfere with their prior planning . Retailers are still looking forward to a good Christmas season , and District retail sales during Thanksgiving week were very encouraging . In addition , a recent newspaper poll revealed some improvement in consumer buying intentions for next year . Except for some increase in farm machinery sales , prospects of a 7 per cent tax credit have not yet affected District investment spending . According to reports received from Bank directors , uncertainty over Phase II has not affected the pace of economic activity in the Ninth District . One director stated that businessmen in his area were going ahead with their plans despite any uncertainty over Phase II . Another director considered Phase II a topic of conversation , but felt that it has not altered business decisions . One report , however , indicated that small businesses had held down , or delayed , raises due to difficulty in interpreting Phase II guidelines . The only adverse impact of Phase II reported by another director was that the time spent by businessmen in interpreting Phase II rules had kept managers away from more productive endeavors .

The directors also felt that the implementation of Phase II has not adversely influenced consumer sentiment in the District , and they reported that District retailers expect their sales to improve .

In contrast to the generally weak business loan demand in other parts of the country , the demand for business loans in the ninth district appears to be quite strong . Conversations with three reserve city bankers revealed that the rise in their business loans is stronger than they had anticipated , and some of these people felt that the recent cuts in the prime rate were unjustified , at least for their banks . One Director , who is also the president of a reserve city bank , said that although he keeps expecting his bank 's outstanding loan balances to fall , they keep rising to new highs . He feels that a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that his national customers have tended to ignore the corporate bond market as a source of debt funds and instead are relying on banks for their borrowings . Three other Directors from rural areas in the district also felt that loan demand was picking up . Although they were not sure of the reasons for the strengthening , they were able to cite instances pointing to a rise in loan demand . One South Dakota Director said , for example , that a number of banks in his area had dropped out of participation pools because they were able to use all their loanable funds for local borrowers .

25,"in the former case , the increase is a recovery from the strike- induced slump . The lack of strong demand is reflected in automobile production . General Motors has reduced overtime schedules and the other automobile producers are operating at reduced levels . Manufacturing shows no sign of a general recovery . There are industries which report a rise in output ( containers , furniture , steel , some machine tools , and textiles ) , but other industries are still retrenching . Although major layoffs of workers are occurring less often , companies are continuing to reduce their workforces through attrition or unpaid holidays . Increased hiring is still not widespread . Investment plans similarly are restrained and expenditures on capital equipment in 1971 are expected to be at about the same level as last year . Even rising new orders for steel are not a reflection of an upturn in the economy but rather represent hedging against either a steel strike or further price rises . According to steel industry economists , overall production for this year will not be above last year . There is one sector which has favorable prospects for recovery . The demand for residential housing is picking up and sales of existing houses are increasing . Nonresidential construction is not as strong at the moment , and in many areas it is quite weak . But the net effect is to increase demand for the output of the building- materials industries and timber .

Higher priced items such as color TV sets and high quality clothing continue to move slowly . Retailers report that inventories of most goods remain at very conservative levels , indicating considerable doubt that the recent upturn in sales will continue . Manufacturers are cautiously optimistic compared with the fact that no change was foreseen a month ago . The Cleveland Bank reports that new steel orders have increased sharply since mid-December . Furthermore , steel industry economists expect a big pickup in steel shipments to begin about March and the second quarter to be much stronger than the first . Much of this anticipated gain is based on rising demand in preparation for a steel strike . The Richmond Bank reported an increase in manufacturers ' inventories . With the exception of the steel companies , however , manufacturers generally do not indicate great gains in sales expectations . In conformity with this view , some layoffs and plant closings have recently occurred in the electronics and TV industries . Most Reserve banks indicate that the current high rate of unemployment is likely to continue for several months . Further declines in employment , however , are not expected as most reports indicate that the retrenchment process of firms is about complete .

Any future increases in the unemployment rate will primarily reflect additions to the labor force rather than layoffs .

28,"August 18 , 1971 The pessimism regarding the economic outlook that had been expressed by the directors of the New York Bank and of the Buffalo Branch last month was still evident , and perhaps intensified , this month ( before the Administration announced its new measures ) . In general , the assessment was for no significant change in consumer attitudes , while some directors believed there had been an actual scaling back of buying intentions ; business inventory spending was not expected to strengthen in the near future ; no noticeable improvement in labor market conditions was foreseen and most of the directors felt that a general economic upturn would gain momentum later than had been generally expected . Concerning consumer spending , the Buffalo Branch directors viewed retail sales activity as relatively better than a year ago , but with no discernible trend either up or down . The New York Branch directors were somewhat more pessimistic . A director from Rochester had had recent discussions with a cross section of New York City department store executives , who reported a slowdown in consumer spending in recent weeks and were generally pessimistic regarding the immediate future . The chairman of the board of a nationwide manufacturing concern believed that consumers were exhibiting caution and more selectivity regarding both price and quality , and saw consumer reluctance showing up particularly in discretionary spending , such as that for travel .

Other directors also thought there had been a scaling back in consumer buying plans",-0.7,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:28:24.042918Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.7}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 21575, 469, 28705, 28740, 28783, 1200, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28740, 415, 284, 409, 321, 1443, 8217, 272, 6638, 575, 5819, 369, 553, 750, 11558, 486, 272, 22650, 302, 272, 1450, 2726, 7838, 304, 302, 272, 28100, 26502, 1432, 2102, 403, 1309, 14885, 1200, 304, 5230, 16698, 1799, 1200, 456, 2102, 325, 1159, 272, 17186, 7004, 871, 633, 10582, 1143, 842, 560, 2952, 1200, 272, 15081, 403, 354, 708, 5864, 2268, 297, 12077, 27044, 1200, 1312, 741, 22650, 7761, 736, 553, 750, 396, 4695, 19903, 852, 302, 9737, 25087, 2753, 1955, 19930, 9981, 403, 459, 3349, 298, 15974, 297, 272, 3065, 3437, 2753, 708, 5640, 522, 14204, 297, 7579, 2668, 4331, 403, 2417, 18226, 304, 1080, 302, 272, 22650, 2770, 369, 264, 2952, 6638, 332, 447, 453, 682, 8356, 14019, 2062, 821, 553, 750, 6741, 3349, 842, 1325, 2742, 971, 12077, 9981, 1200, 272, 28100, 26502, 22650, 16861, 11603, 6292, 6355, 390, 10102, 1873, 821, 264, 879, 3584, 1200, 562, 395, 708, 2312, 1173, 1070, 9156, 2477, 582, 442, 1060, 842, 415, 1450, 2726, 26502, 22650, 654, 10963, 680, 284, 409, 321, 3320, 842, 330, 6859, 477, 26330, 2406, 553, 553, 5391, 18382, 395, 264, 3893, 4211, 302, 1450, 2726, 3805, 9784, 4143, 4546, 1771, 1200, 693, 5745, 264, 3944, 3254, 297, 12077, 9981, 297, 5391, 4587, 304, 654, 6741, 284, 409, 321, 3320, 8217, 272, 11399, 3437, 842, 415, 21572, 302, 272, 5113, 302, 264, 5878, 5734, 15186, 4368, 7761, 369, 13776, 654, 8244, 4328, 26769, 304, 680, 5339, 2574, 8217, 1560, 4144, 304, 4045, 1200, 304, 2672, 12077, 19238, 617, 8102, 582, 6311, 297, 22683, 296, 628, 9981, 1200, 1259, 390, 369, 354, 4530, 842, 13, 13, 15681, 22650, 835, 1654, 736, 553, 750, 264, 19903, 852, 297, 12077, 9737, 6400, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 387, 28734, 28723, 28787, 28752], 'total_duration': 2589995400, 'load_duration': 7328800, 'prompt_eval_count': 358, 'prompt_eval_duration': 981728000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1599047000}"
29,"July 21 , 1971 The opinions expressed recently by Second District Federal Reserve Bank directors seemed to reflect some renewed doubts regarding the strength of the economic recovery . The directors in general foresaw no near-term improvement in the unemployment picture—indeed a few expected further weakening—and some felt that additional disruptive strikes were in the offing . On the other hand , the outlook for consumer spending and residential construction remains good ; no significant changes in the trends in these sectors were thought to have occurred in the recent past . Most of the directors felt that a widespread lack of confidence among both businessmen and consumers is a major factor in the disappointingly slow rate of economic recovery . Concerning the unemployment situation , the directors felt the continuing efforts of businessmen to cut back costs made it unlikely that a significant reduction of unemployment would be achieved in the coming months . The chairman of the board of a large New York City bank said he expected that his firm would have a smaller staff at the end of 1971 than it had earlier in the year , and felt that other financial institutions-the city 's strongest employers—also would not contribute much support for the local job market this year . The president of a nationwide manufacturer of plumbing and related products felt that the wage-cost squeeze was forcing industry to cut back on spending and employment .

The Buffalo Branch directors agreed that labor markets in their locality generally continue to experience",-0.5,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:28:26.6086217Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.5}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 28798, 3089, 28705, 28750, 28740, 1200, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28740, 415, 15028, 11558, 5915, 486, 7052, 8207, 11652, 22249, 7838, 22650, 3593, 298, 7967, 741, 13293, 286, 28687, 8217, 272, 6342, 302, 272, 6638, 12106, 842, 415, 22650, 297, 2952, 285, 3626, 1067, 708, 3065, 28733, 6590, 14204, 297, 272, 28634, 5754, 28821, 8355, 286, 264, 1664, 3349, 3629, 478, 2589, 288, 28821, 391, 741, 2770, 369, 4870, 28679, 495, 24128, 654, 297, 272, 805, 288, 842, 1418, 272, 799, 1021, 1200, 272, 575, 5819, 354, 12077, 9981, 304, 18350, 6380, 7520, 1179, 2753, 708, 5864, 4435, 297, 272, 17869, 297, 1167, 23014, 654, 1654, 298, 506, 9894, 297, 272, 5391, 2609, 842, 4822, 302, 272, 22650, 2770, 369, 264, 23723, 5502, 302, 9843, 3352, 1560, 1955, 2129, 304, 13776, 349, 264, 3014, 6999, 297, 272, 10734, 7381, 3944, 4338, 302, 6638, 12106, 842, 1325, 2742, 971, 272, 28634, 4620, 1200, 272, 22650, 2770, 272, 15317, 8280, 302, 1955, 2129, 298, 3119, 852, 6966, 1269, 378, 15764, 369, 264, 5864, 13388, 302, 28634, 682, 347, 12011, 297, 272, 3524, 3370, 842, 415, 21572, 302, 272, 5113, 302, 264, 2475, 1450, 2726, 3805, 5206, 773, 400, 3349, 369, 516, 5799, 682, 506, 264, 7000, 5084, 438, 272, 948, 302, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28740, 821, 378, 553, 5585, 297, 272, 879, 1200, 304, 2770, 369, 799, 5593, 12638, 28733, 1237, 2990, 464, 28713, 27686, 22271, 28821, 18033, 682, 459, 14951, 1188, 1760, 354, 272, 1862, 2389, 2668, 456, 879, 842, 415, 4951, 302, 264, 5878, 5734, 17746, 302, 549, 27010, 304, 5202, 4076, 2770, 369, 272, 21062, 28733, 14174, 11322, 19961, 403, 20504, 4779, 298, 3119, 852, 356, 9981, 304, 14087, 842, 13, 13, 1014, 28100, 26502, 22650, 5825, 369, 7579, 11574, 297, 652, 1862, 472, 6741, 3688, 298, 2659, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 387, 28734, 28723, 28782, 28752], 'total_duration': 2561126700, 'load_duration': 8160500, 'prompt_eval_count': 365, 'prompt_eval_duration': 981662000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1568873000}"
30,"April 6 , 1971 The opinions expressed by the Directors of this Bank and the Buffalo branch and other business leaders in general continued to point to an uncertain economic outlook . On balance , the assessment was : a still cautious consumer attitude ; a somewhat less optimistic residential construction picture ; little or no improvement in the unemployment situation ; and relatively uninspiring prospects for 1971 corporate profits . Sentiments were mixed with respect to the likely volume of further corporate borrowing in the bond market . In view of most of the Directors and of the retailers that were contacted , the long awaited rebound in consumer spending has not as yet materialized . Indeed , it was generally believed that no real pickup in consumer spending could be expected as long as consumer confidence continued to be adversely affected by the unemployment situation . Several of the respondents , however , felt that given the current high rates of individual savings , a change in consumer mood could well trigger a sharp increase in such outlays . With respect to residential housing construction the picture painted by the respondents was somewhat less rosy than it had been in earlier months . To be sure , the consensus was that there still remained a shortage of housing for lower and middle income families , and that mortgage money had become more readily available at lower rates .

Manufacturers report increases in shipments , new orders and backlogs of orders , and retail sales continue relatively strong . Construction activity is not as vigorous as it has been in recent months , with some slackening in residential construction being especially evident . Loan demand continues to follow the pattern set in recent months , with consumer loan demand especially strong . In general , District manufacturers report that shipments , new orders , and backlogs of orders are up over the previous reporting period . Increases are reported in such industries as furniture , textiles , chemicals , and electrical equipment , while decreases are reported by hosiery , apparel , and synthetic fiber producers . Manufacturers ' inventories were reported to have increased slightly for the first time in several months and the level of inventories , relative to desired levels , showed some improvement over last month . Although the long coal strike dampened business activity in some areas , on balance District bankers and businessmen in trade and services report that retail , sales are up in their areas .

Total sales for 1971 were 7 percent higher than in 1970 . The cotton harvest in Texas and Oklahoma , which was the latest in 20 years , is nearing completion . The cotton harvest in Arizona , Louisiana , and New Mexico is also virtually finished . The cotton crop in the District states is expected to total slightly less than 4.3 million bales . That is well below the 4.6 million bale crop in 1970 . Higher prevailing prices for all quantities of cotton are partially offsetting the production losses which were attributable to unseasonably cold and wet weather .

On January 1 , Texas had 20 percent more cattle on feed than a year earlier , but the number on feed in Arizona declined slightly during the same period . The index of livestock and livestock products rose substantially from mid-November through mid-January as beef cattle and hog prices were up sharply .",0.3,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:28:46.4155642Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 507, 294, 3117, 302, 11603, 9981, 654, 9430, 842, 2678, 2174, 697, 302, 633, 18990, 4607, 598, 3429, 5970, 28705, 28787, 4153, 477, 272, 2102, 1159, 297, 19041, 1200, 6963, 394, 2217, 1200, 16904, 1200, 304, 3652, 13172, 842, 1092, 14931, 20851, 24113, 697, 297, 272, 2308, 18015, 354, 272, 879, 654, 28705, 28750, 28734, 4153, 6517, 821, 297, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28734, 842, 6946, 4143, 6292, 297, 272, 12450, 1071, 28716, 8207, 654, 28705, 28740, 28740, 4153, 4337, 297, 272, 2308, 4587, 7054, 4624, 28705, 28750, 28750, 821, 297, 272, 7606, 3216, 264, 879, 1159, 842, 10711, 6292, 354, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28740, 654, 28705, 28787, 4153, 4337, 821, 297, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28734, 842, 415, 18633, 20040, 297, 7826, 304, 23565, 1200, 690, 403, 272, 7345, 297, 28705, 28750, 28734, 1267, 1200, 349, 435, 2302, 15151, 842, 415, 18633, 20040, 297, 17289, 1200, 24269, 1200, 304, 1450, 10242, 349, 835, 17626, 5967, 842, 415, 18633, 21948, 297, 272, 8207, 4605, 349, 3349, 298, 3102, 7191, 2108, 821, 28705, 28781, 28723, 28770, 3841, 287, 2230, 842, 1725, 349, 1162, 3624, 272, 28705, 28781, 28723, 28784, 3841, 287, 883, 21948, 297, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28734, 842, 14327, 663, 8177, 16615, 8506, 354, 544, 21709, 302, 18633, 460, 19966, 4470, 1157, 272, 4885, 16275, 690, 654, 19096, 522, 298, 521, 17956, 1907, 5256, 304, 7569, 8086, 842, 23121, 374, 629, 4331, 460, 6741, 1179, 297, 272, 8207, 842, 1418, 4624, 28705, 28740, 1200, 7826, 553, 28705, 28750, 28734, 4153, 680, 23137, 356, 5575, 821, 264, 879, 5585, 1200, 562, 272, 1474, 356, 5575, 297, 17289, 23043, 7191, 1938, 272, 1348, 3216, 842, 415, 2991, 302, 9678, 374, 629, 304, 9678, 374, 629, 4076, 8536, 10883, 1929, 477, 4725, 28733, 28759, 4208, 1059, 4725, 28733, 21650, 4084, 390, 21189, 23137, 304, 295, 476, 8506, 654, 582, 26002, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28770, 28752], 'total_duration': 2602555200, 'load_duration': 5730300, 'prompt_eval_count': 375, 'prompt_eval_duration': 991368000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1603336000}"
38,"October 11 , 1972 Indicators of economic activity in the Eleventh District were mixed in August . Although the Texas Industrial Production Index eased slightly from its revised record level in July , the unemployment rate for the five District states declined , and employment continued to increase . Department store sales in the District also continued strong , and construction activity rebounded sharply . However , the rate of new car registrations declined slightly . A decrease in the production of nonmanufactured goods was primarily responsible for the slight decline in the seasonally adjusted Texas Industrial Production Index in August . The decline was centered in public utilities and crude oil mining . Nevertheless , production in both these industries was well above its level of a year ago . The Index for manufacturing industries remained essentially unchanged . Seasonally adjusted total nonagricultural employment in the five Southwestern states rose to a record level in August and helped to push the unemployment rate down slightly . Both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing employment increased , with employment in durable goods manufacturing and mining showing particularly notable gains . Government employment and employment in service industries also increased in August . Slight employment declines were reported in construction and transportation and public utilities . However , all industry groups posted year-to-year gains .

39,"February 9 , 1972 Phase II policies , and competitive market forces operating in an economy performing well below its potential , are apparently combining to moderate the pace of rising prices . A survey of purchasing agents and managers in the Tenth District indicates that they perceive ( 1 ) a somewhat slower rate of price rise for materials they purchase , ( 2 ) generally good compliance by vendors with Phase II guidelines , and ( 3 ) the existence of market forces also acting to restrain price increases . Inventory policy is quite conservative , with little buildup of stocks now anticipated , almost regardless of industry . Among District banks , consumer installment lending and agricultural loan demand remain strong , while local business loan demand has shown little change in recent weeks from its basically weak position . The view from the desks of purchasing managers in the Tenth District seems to be favorable to Phase II , with overall understanding and compliance felt to be generally good . Specific comments suggest that , as far as purchasing agents are concerned , vendors generally appear to be following the Phase II guidelines . Purchasing agents for a number of firms regularly review suppliers ' prices for compliance , some require invoices to be stamped as in accordance with Price Commission rulings , and others report that notices of price rises are accompanied with word that they have been cleared with the Price Commission .

40,"August 9 , 1972 The vigor in the economic recovery reflected nationally in the most recent GNP figures appears to be mirrored in the sales reports of a number of Tenth District manufacturing firms as well as in comments elicited from bank directors . Increased sales were reported quite generally , and although little evidence of stockpiling is evident , inventory spending is keeping pace with recent sales improvements . Some firms reported longer delivery times to their customers , and there were scattered reports of lengthening lead times for inventory purchases from their suppliers . Despite sales increases , however , few of the firms contacted have added net to their work forces , and , as a consequence , there were a number of firms which reported noticeable productivity gains . Tenth District farm income rose more sharply than for the nation as a whole in the first six months of 1972 , and income prospects for all of 1972 appear to be quite strong vis-a-vis last year . Strong loan demand continues at Tenth District banks , and , with few exceptions , District banks have experienced large increases in total deposits .

48,"wage increases for fear of bringing back Phase One-type controls . Professors Eckstein , Samuelson , and Shapiro were available for comment this month . All felt the major problem for the economy is to get Phase Three `` off the ground '' . Shapiro criticized the strange and contradictory statements about Phase Three which have been made by members of the Administration . He urges greater clarification . He cited the relatively flat yield curve as evidence that `` people with money do not have inflationary expectations '' . Due to a lot of bad luck ( weather conditions and blight ) and high income elasticity of the demand for meat , Samuelson doubts prices can be held to the stated goals . Specifically , the 5.5 percent wage standard is not possible to achieve , given the recent and likely future path of the cost of living . On the other hand , cost-push inflation is not something that the monetary authorities can or ought to do a lot about , according to Samuelson . Samuelson also felt it inadvisable to be committed to a dollar parity rate at the cost of tighter interest rates than would be justified on the grounds of domestic policy . While Shapiro would have preferred to have let the dollar float , he urged the United States to stand firm in not supporting the dollar , forcing other countries to take either goods or dollars .

Such a shakeout has been in progress for the past year in modular home building , and plant shutdowns are still reported . The mortgage market has eased with rates in the Detroit area reduced from 9 to 8.5 percent in the past few weeks . The 8 percent usury ceiling in Illinois continues to limit new loans .

Nevertheless , a recent survey shows prices of existing homes in the Chicago area to average 10 percent above a year earlier , compared to an 8 percent rise in the previous 12 months . This Bank 's survey of farmland values shows an average increase of 17 percent from a year ago as of October 1 , and a rise of 8 percent in the third quarter . These are the largest increases in the 20 years of the survey . The soybean and corn harvests are coming along very well . Most areas report lower grain moisture content ( and better quality ) than last year , so less fuel will be needed for drying .

Those associated with capital goods and consumer goods areas mentioned that business has been extremely good , both they and their customers are having difficulty in building inventories . Several of the directors reported that they plan to keep a tight rein on their inventory situation , however . Some of the directors were of the opinion that part of the strength in new orders was the result of numerous capital goods customers placing advance orders because they fear shortages later this year . Concern was also expressed about the effect of recent price behavior on the large number of major labor negotiations scheduled through 1973 . Some of the directors are also becoming concerned about the prospects for a reduced pace of business activity in 1974 . One director whose diversified firm has record orders in all areas of its business , mentioned specifically that he expects a drop off in business next year and is therefore avoiding an overextension of plant capacity . Economists from major firms in the area are also reporting ebullient business conditions , and they are projecting a sustained high level of operations—at or near capacity—through 1973 .

53,"November 14 , 1973 Business activity in the District remains strong , although there are some signs of slowing . Apart from the weakening in housing and consumer durables , the slowing is probably more a reflection of capacity limitations and a tight supply situation in raw materials and fuels than the result of a decline in underlying demand . Our Directors and businessmen and economists in the District are gravely concerned over the energy situation and its implications for the economy in 1974 . Output in the District 's manufacturing sector continues to rise , but signs of slowing in the upward momentum are accumulating . Our monthly survey of manufacturers shows a significant decline in the proportion of firms reporting gains in new orders and backlogs in recent months . September was the poorest month of the year , and early returns for October suggest further weakening occurred . There has also been some slowdown in the rate of inventory accumulation . Delivery time , however , continues to lengthen , compounding the problem of shortages faced by virtually every firm . ( The October report of Cleveland purchasing agents questioned how there could be a recession next year in view of the fact that very little inventory is available and deliveries are taking three to six months or more on practically everything . ) There was a surge in price increases during October , as the largest proportion of firms in the ten-year history of our survey reported paying higher prices .

One major firm just opened its order books for first quarter delivery , and they expect to be filled by December .

Cutback in either oil or natural gas will affect their output . In addition , one major steel firm is short on coal and coke .

56,"their outlook . Most respondents expect short-term market rates of interest to increase over the next six months , but only a few expect substantially higher short-term rates . The majority anticipate little change in long-term rates , although some expect a moderate increase in these rates . None expect either category of rates to be lower . Almost none of the respondents anticipate that the prime lending rate will rise above 7 percent at either midyear or the year-end . In reply to questions relating to their particular banks , our directors indicated that business , consumer , and mortgage loan demand strengthened moderately during the last three months . Only agricultural loan demand remained essentially unchanged . Most respondents did not essentially change their willingness to make mortgage and agricultural loans during the last three months . A few were even more moderately willing to make consumer and business loans . Taking into account their expectations for loan demand , our directors generally rated funds either very available or moderately available at their banks . Slightly more than half are aggressively seeking large certificates of deposit ( CDs ) . While the majority were paying less than 6 percent for 30- to 89-day large CDs , most were paying between 6 and 7 percent for CDs with maturities beyond 89 days . The Directors split half and half as to whether they expect disintermediation of savings and time deposits in the coming six months .

58,"April 11 , 1973 This month 's district Red Book reports indicate that the current vigorous expansion is increasingly straining capacity . Raw material shortages , lengthening delivery times and difficulties in finding skilled labor are emerging . Inflation is again the major economic concern with recent price increases rekindling inflationary fears . All districts reported continuing gains in economic activity , with most Banks describing business conditions in terms like `` robust '' ( Atlanta ) , `` expanding at a rapid pace '' ( Cleveland and Dallas ) , and '' strong '' ( Minneapolis ) . The labor picture , however , varies sharply among districts . Dallas reports the unemployment rate dropping to 3.6 percent , while the First District is still experiencing unemployment rates above 6 percent . Philadelphia reports modest gains in employment , while Chicago , Cleveland , Dallas , Atlanta , and St. Louis have tight labor markets with significant skilled labor shortages . Growing raw material shortages and lengthening delivery times were also mentioned by most Banks .

70,"February 13 , 1974 Generalizations of the current economic situation in the Seventh District have never been so difficult since the Red Book was launched almost four years ago . The growing ramifications of the energy crisis , continued rapid price inflation in the face of cutbacks in output and employment , widespread shortages , and dissatisfaction with government at all levels have created an unprecedented atmosphere of uncertainty among consumers and businessmen . This mood has been deepened by the independent truckers ' strike which began at the end of January and is not yet fully resolved . Communities dependent on the manufacture of full-sized cars and recreational vehicles are economic disaster areas . In contrast , equipment producers generally are experiencing an unparalleled boom , with many firms unable to meet production schedules . While shortages of materials and components seem worse than ever , there are reports of firms doing precautionary advance buying ( hoarding ) of fuel and supplies of other scarce materials . Most businessmen , apparently , would favor the complete abandonment of price and wage controls .

'' According to this director , electric utilities are canceling atomic plants because of their high capital costs , and substituting less capital intensive coal and oil plants . The irony is that atomic plants have fixed fuel costs , while coal and oil plants have rising fuel costs—so the shift away from atomic plants is inflationary in the long run . A second director confirmed this , noting that both atomic and fossil plants have been canceled because of the high cost of financing and load demand running below expectations . A number of these facilities were slated for completion after 1980 . In addition , because of rising construction costs , there is a rush to complete those plants currently under construction .

76,"January 16 , 1974 Scarcity of pipe , rigs , and work crews continues to constrain petroleum drilling in the Southwest , according to an association of drillers , since many do not have permanent workers or established lines of supply . The association reports that the shortage of drilling rigs could be a problem for as long as three years because capacity constraints are limiting the ability of manufacturers to fill a growing backlog of orders . The seasonally adjusted index of industrial production in Texas fell in November for the first time since July 1973 . The decline was centered in mining of crude oil , petroleum refining , and production of petroleum-related chemicals . Despite intensified drilling , mining of crude oil has decreased because of the reduction of domestic reserves of crude . At the same time , shortages of crude oil have contributed to the reduction in refining activity , although in recent weeks imports have been greater than they were earlier anticipated to be . Unscheduled shutdowns for repairs and maintenance have also hampered refining . A survey of manufacturers based in Texas indicates that many firms are taking action to stockpile petroleum or petroleum-related products . While many businesses complained about more limited supplies and rising prices , there is no evidence that petroleum or related products are unobtainable .

Shortages were reported in plastics , solvents , and diesel fuel , but many manufacturers seemed just as concerned about the scarcity of nonpetroleum materials such as steel ,",-0.5,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:30:22.8989786Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.5}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 21650, 4084, 28705, 28740, 28784, 1200, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28781, 2522, 6527, 472, 302, 13661, 1200, 10536, 28713, 1200, 304, 771, 1317, 6420, 10352, 298, 8130, 426, 5408, 9606, 383, 1605, 8317, 297, 272, 3658, 7471, 1200, 4771, 298, 396, 13895, 302, 1605, 425, 404, 1200, 1854, 1287, 511, 459, 506, 13089, 7433, 442, 6740, 4715, 302, 8002, 842, 415, 13895, 7959, 369, 272, 2485, 465, 302, 1605, 8317, 10536, 28713, 829, 347, 264, 2700, 354, 390, 1043, 390, 1712, 1267, 1096, 8444, 14841, 460, 27931, 272, 5537, 302, 19245, 298, 5211, 264, 6485, 852, 1582, 302, 8636, 842, 415, 3302, 578, 21875, 2991, 302, 10663, 4885, 297, 7826, 5970, 297, 4349, 354, 272, 907, 727, 1854, 4398, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28770, 842, 415, 17468, 403, 25904, 297, 15121, 302, 5337, 450, 5503, 1200, 5408, 9606, 383, 1792, 4038, 1200, 304, 4885, 302, 5408, 9606, 383, 28733, 9646, 24920, 842, 10191, 16698, 1799, 1605, 8317, 1200, 15121, 302, 5337, 450, 5503, 659, 8512, 1293, 1096, 302, 272, 13388, 302, 12866, 26863, 302, 5337, 450, 842, 1794, 272, 1348, 727, 1200, 2485, 1291, 302, 5337, 450, 5503, 506, 18746, 298, 272, 13388, 297, 1792, 4038, 6355, 1200, 5432, 297, 5391, 4587, 28365, 506, 750, 6517, 821, 590, 654, 5585, 25024, 298, 347, 842, 935, 28713, 23382, 6409, 3254, 28713, 354, 24767, 304, 12364, 506, 835, 11218, 487, 286, 1792, 4038, 842, 330, 10911, 302, 19245, 2818, 297, 7826, 12825, 369, 1287, 18253, 460, 3344, 2992, 298, 5756, 28720, 546, 5408, 9606, 383, 442, 5408, 9606, 383, 28733, 9646, 4076, 842, 4023, 1287, 8689, 25057, 684, 680, 6516, 13679, 304, 11862, 8506, 1200, 736, 349, 708, 5566, 369, 5408, 9606, 383, 442, 5202, 4076, 460, 521, 598, 12092, 522, 842, 13, 13, 13026, 1291, 654, 5745, 297, 549, 529, 1063, 1200, 2128, 28728, 788, 1200, 304, 5148, 301, 10624, 1200, 562, 1287, 19245, 3593, 776, 390, 9059, 684, 272, 28276, 472, 302, 1843, 6193, 9606, 383, 7069, 1259, 390, 9445, 1200, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 387, 28734, 28723, 28782, 28752], 'total_duration': 2595297200, 'load_duration': 6319800, 'prompt_eval_count': 396, 'prompt_eval_duration': 999864000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1585903000}"
77,"September 5 , 1974 An informal poll of director opinion reveals a considerable deterioration in expectations tied mainly to the slump in stock market prices . Concern over bank liquidity and credit quality is evident , but primary worries are on the status of the economy . Most directors believe the nation will be facing very difficult business conditions for at least the remainder of 1974 . However , most also believe we have no choice but to stay with a heavily restrictive monetary policy to dampen inflation . They believe that possible increased restraint in fiscal policy might permit some modest easing of credit restraint . Increased output of petrochemicals accounts for much of the continued growth in industrial production in the Eleventh District . Petroleum refining has grown steadily since March when foreign oil began flowing to Texas refineries . Crude runs to stills have now climbed well above the levels that prevailed prior to the Arab oil embargo , and expanded refinery output has increased feedstocks to chemical producers who are hard pressed to meet soaring demand . Industrial production has also been boosted by gains in textile output . Shortages of fibers have eased and have allowed textile producers to replace badly depleted inventories of finished goods . Paper producers , on the other hand , report the availability of wood pulp remains tight , but they have been able to increase output nonetheless .

The boom in drilling continues , although constrained by availability of equipment and trained manpower .

Given the recent planting difficulties in the spring wheat regions , 1974 wheat production may fall short of official estimates . However , the crop is still expected to surpass last year 's record of 1.7 billion bushels .

80,". Conditions in the manufacturing sector are spotty , reflecting the sluggishness in the housing and consumer sectors on the one hand and the relative strength of capital spending on the other . Industries closely related to housing and consumer durables ( lumber , glass , textiles , furniture , and appliances ) are noticeably weaker . In addition , several Districts ( New York , Chicago , Kansas City , and San Francisco ) report that some industrial materials , particularly fuels , certain chemicals , and paper , are more readily available . The easing of supply constraints in these industries is contributing to less aggressive purchasing and some declines in order backlogs . Cleveland , Chicago , Kansas City , and Dallas indicate somewhat softer prices for chemicals , fuels , and other materials , but no major break in industrial prices has occurred to date . Steel markets remain tight in most Districts , due in part to the prospective coal strike . Both Cleveland and San Francisco suggest an easing in the steel situation in coming months , however , due to the increased availability of foreign steel . The agricultural outlook appears generally weaker . Atlanta reports favorable harvest yields with the exception of the hurricane-damaged Louisiana sugar cane crop . But Chicago , St. Louis , Minneapolis , and Kansas City indicate that early frosts will substantially reduce corn and soybean yields , reducing farm incomes and increasing feed costs .

The respondents generally expected further significant price increases . Consumer outlays remained relatively strong in the New York City area , but some weakening was noted upstate . Construction is expected to be further adversely affected by the rise in short-term interest rates and the resulting outflow of funds from thrift institutions . Views regarding the prospective demand for short-term business credit were mixed but on balance pointed to a sustained strong demand . The directors in general agreed that the slackening in business activity which has occurred in recent months is likely to be followed by an improvement as the year wears on . The president of a large chemical corporation thus characterized the slack in the economy as minor , and the president of a large nationwide retail concern looked for some improvement in the second half of the year . The president of a multinational nonferrous metal concern expected a moderate increase in real GNP for the year as a whole .

Some difficulty is reported in obtaining delivery of previously ordered merchandise , particularly for the most popular new styles in soft goods and for nationally advertised toys . Most retailers regard these shortages as a usual seasonal characteristic , although the decision of some apparel manufacturers to operate on a strict `` cut-to-order '' basis is mentioned as a source of longer lead times . A related factor is the increasing number of yarn varieties , which creates a difficult inventory problem for textile raw materials manufacturers in view of more volatile shifts in demand for particular finished goods styles . Retail inventory levels are well-balanced on the whole , although some remaining excess is reported in expensive furniture lines and to a lesser degree in appliances and other big-ticket items . Retailers expect continued gains in 1976 , although some concern is noted regarding the depth of the post-holiday season downturn in consumer durable goods .

Local area businessmen and directors ' opinions are mixed concerning the impact of automobile price rebates and post holiday retail sales . Generally , sales seem to be holding up better than previously expected . Besides auto rebates , several other instances of price cutting were reported again this month . Industrial and commercial investment plans , despite some retrenchment , remain reasonably strong in the face of last year 's weak economy and little improvement yet this year . Unemployment in the District continues on the rise , as it does nationally , but the extent of the rise varies throughout the region . Florida and Georgia have been hardest hit , and unemployment rates in these states are higher than the nation 's . Both states are typically well below the national unemployment rate . Alabama and Mississippi , though showing some increases in unemployment , seem to be holding their own .

He fears that though things look rather hopeful on first blush , the economy has no holding power—the financial condition of business especially is unfavorable and we risk stagnation if the rebound is not nurtured . He sees nonmonetary forces fueling a 6 percent inflation rate should 4 percent growth be attained ; 7.5 percent money growth would risk another slump . We need not lock the throttle at higher rates of money expansion ; we need to assist the recovery . Eckstein notes that the economy is still fundamentally weak , and his forecasts are `` a gamble that the tax cut will work '' and that monetary policy is stimulative . He is sympathetic with the use of the federal funds rate as a target and he is relieved to see that it has eased somewhat . He notes that a 5 percent funds rate accompanies 8.3 percent money growth in his model—this is close enough to 7.5 percent to be well within our margins of forecasting and control errors . Five percent money growth would produce a depression and would be plausible only if inflation falls to the 1 to 2 percent level . Samuelson senses that the trough is near . He sees no rebound in housing or autos for some time , but it is a good bet that growth will exceed 4 to 5",-0.3,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:31:11.5389025Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 391, 20613, 842, 650, 682, 737, 298, 1032, 264, 25797, 3889, 8432, 10419, 4338, 22081, 395, 2445, 6057, 302, 28705, 28740, 28734, 4153, 354, 264, 1664, 3370, 842, 650, 20142, 369, 2070, 1722, 913, 3210, 3317, 1007, 356, 907, 843, 1426, 1200, 272, 8725, 659, 708, 6632, 1982, 28821, 1237, 5593, 4644, 302, 1955, 4012, 349, 10077, 3115, 522, 304, 478, 4623, 341, 3450, 352, 513, 272, 312, 7250, 349, 459, 307, 3525, 2330, 842, 650, 12477, 1843, 2640, 23101, 6894, 10624, 288, 264, 28705, 28784, 4153, 20613, 4338, 1023, 28705, 28781, 4153, 6057, 347, 998, 1738, 2753, 28705, 28787, 28723, 28782, 4153, 2445, 6057, 682, 4623, 1698, 1135, 1804, 842, 816, 927, 459, 4344, 272, 8379, 781, 291, 438, 4337, 7978, 302, 2445, 11120, 2753, 478, 927, 298, 6031, 272, 12106, 842, 413, 606, 6559, 8321, 369, 272, 8725, 349, 1309, 9676, 578, 6334, 1200, 304, 516, 19912, 28713, 460, 5008, 264, 11129, 982, 369, 272, 3947, 3119, 622, 771, 9842, 304, 369, 1326, 23101, 4920, 349, 12556, 20851, 842, 650, 349, 4297, 27642, 395, 272, 938, 302, 272, 8432, 10419, 4338, 390, 264, 2718, 304, 400, 349, 23564, 298, 1032, 369, 378, 659, 317, 1293, 10963, 842, 650, 8321, 369, 264, 28705, 28782, 4153, 10419, 4338, 13498, 497, 28705, 28783, 28723, 28770, 4153, 2445, 6057, 297, 516, 2229, 28821, 894, 349, 2848, 2066, 298, 28705, 28787, 28723, 28782, 4153, 298, 347, 1162, 2373, 813, 15003, 1126, 302, 19912, 288, 304, 2602, 7559, 842, 15243, 4153, 2445, 6057, 682, 7072, 264, 14992, 304, 682, 347, 549, 1899, 1070, 865, 513, 20613, 14179, 298, 272, 28705, 28740, 298, 28705, 28750, 4153, 2184, 842, 4157, 28718, 14814, 23086, 369, 272, 467, 900, 349, 3065, 842, 650, 12477, 708, 312, 7250, 297, 11821, 442, 1206, 385, 354, 741, 727, 1200, 562, 378, 349, 264, 1179, 924, 369, 6057, 622, 12436, 28705, 28781, 298, 28705, 28782, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 387, 28734, 28723, 28770, 28752], 'total_duration': 2592764600, 'load_duration': 7827000, 'prompt_eval_count': 378, 'prompt_eval_duration': 993180000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1589317000}"

A Fort Worth manufacturer of reinforcing steel bars said mills are engaged in the most aggressive price-cutting that he has seen in 25 years in the industry . Many jobs are actually being bid below cost as mills try to keep their share of the market and attempt to hold on to the backbone of their work force .

The respondents feel changes are due but not in the direction of those proposed . Not only would changes now being considered roll back crude oil prices from an average of $ 8.75 per barrel to $ 7.66 , but legislation would tighten the rules expensing intangible drilling costs . The latter change would reduce funds available for drilling and impact most severely on small independents , who account for much exploratory drilling .

Consequently , cash flows to farmers and ranches have improved , and rural bankers report the rate of loan repayment has increased while the number of renewals and extensions has declined . Although flush with funds , agribankers continue to be very cautious in granting credit . Uncertainty over markets and weather and the carryover effects of depressed incomes in 1974 , particularly among cattle feeders , serve to keep collateral requirements firm . Nevertheless , agricultural lending this fall is above year-earlier levels . Rising production costs and slightly more acreage in cultivation have increased the farmer 's demand for bank credit .

In addition , directors report that District businesses have not been confronted with overly excessive inventories ; inflationary pressures have also eased . The District 's rural areas continue to be relatively unaffected by the recession . Unemployment continues to rise . The District 's unemployment rate , seasonally adjusted , increased from 5.9 percent to 6.4 percent between December and January , with the Minneapolis-St. Paul area rate jumping from 5.1 percent to 6.2 percent . In early 1975 , District help-wanted advertising was down 30 percent from a year ago and initial claims for unemployment insurance were up 35 percent . District manufacturers are not so optimistic about their sales outlook as they were last November . After increasing 15.9 percent from a year earlier in the fourth quarter , District manufacturers look for their sales to surpass year-ago levels by around 9 percent during the first nine months of this year .

Recent figures , though improved from the beginning of this year , were well below the numbers issued in the early 1970s . Also , district nonresidential building spending remained down from a year ago . Savings deposit growth at district commercial banks and savings and loan associations slowed somewhat in the third quarter , following rapid growth during the first half of 1975 . The slowdown largely reflected the growing attractiveness of U.S. Government Securities , whose yields have risen above the highest rates that savings institutions are permitted to pay . Mortgage loans closed and mortgage loan commitments by district S & Ls continued to climb rapidly in the third quarter . However , if past relationships prevail , S & Ls will soon be scaling back the volume of new loan commitments to match the slower savings growth . Loan growth at district commercial banks strengthened substantially in September from the weak pattern that had existed during 1975 .",-0.6,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:31:29.1917548Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 28708, 879, 3584, 842, 415, 1676, 28733, 364, 4136, 3088, 715, 297, 1611, 19405, 403, 459, 25859, 297, 272, 4008, 8249, 842, 382, 23291, 5028, 3227, 13809, 297, 4398, 28733, 21575, 469, 865, 16933, 1676, 28733, 364, 4136, 6157, 842, 27727, 10389, 1200, 2070, 11957, 477, 272, 5398, 302, 456, 879, 1200, 654, 1162, 3624, 272, 5551, 11793, 297, 272, 2935, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28734, 28713, 842, 4840, 1200, 7181, 1843, 411, 27357, 3667, 9981, 7568, 1060, 477, 264, 879, 3584, 842, 11210, 742, 17435, 6057, 438, 7181, 7380, 13283, 304, 17665, 304, 9976, 25963, 28636, 10963, 297, 272, 4008, 8249, 1200, 2296, 8421, 6057, 1938, 272, 907, 2795, 302, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28782, 842, 415, 3944, 3254, 12282, 17222, 272, 6485, 6842, 9992, 302, 500, 28723, 28735, 28723, 9714, 4554, 324, 1218, 1200, 4636, 18934, 506, 6599, 269, 2747, 272, 7881, 7978, 369, 17665, 12638, 460, 15463, 298, 2136, 842, 14789, 11332, 15556, 5051, 304, 18222, 9976, 5453, 1339, 486, 7181, 318, 567, 393, 28713, 5317, 298, 17176, 14099, 297, 272, 4008, 8249, 842, 2993, 1200, 513, 2609, 9391, 8177, 614, 1200, 318, 567, 393, 28713, 622, 3403, 347, 19903, 852, 272, 7531, 302, 633, 9976, 5453, 1339, 298, 2918, 272, 25642, 17665, 6057, 842, 7300, 276, 6057, 438, 7181, 7380, 13283, 15974, 286, 10883, 1929, 297, 4074, 477, 272, 6334, 5340, 369, 553, 16947, 1938, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28782, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 387, 28734, 28723, 28784, 28752], 'total_duration': 2408891200, 'load_duration': 5620500, 'prompt_eval_count': 300, 'prompt_eval_duration': 839255000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1562119000}"
104,"January 15 , 1975 District `` Red Book '' reports for mid-January generally reflect the accentuation in most parts of the country of the pronounced deterioration of the economy in the recent past suggested by nationwide economic indicators . Retail sales in most areas over the holiday season were only equal or barely above last year 's level in dollar terms and , given the sharp rise in retail prices over the past year , lower in volume . Moreover , this year 's level was achieved only by dint of heavy pre-Christmas aggressive promotion , special sales , and price cutting in addition to the usual early January clearance sales . Against this background , a number of respondents in various Districts regarded retail inventories to be relatively high to excessive in relation to current sale prospects , with increased reports of efforts to reduce positions , both at the retail and manufacturing level . Planned business plant and equipment outlays , apart from energy related industries , on balance appeared to be weaker than had been expected , and a number of Districts report cutbacks , or outright cancellations of planned projects . The private residential construction , and to a lesser extent commercial construction , picture remained bleak , although a reported moderate reversal in the outflow of deposits at thrift institutions gives hope that the eventual bottoming of the decline in that industry may be approaching .

Recent announcements involve such industries as printing , chemicals , shipbuilding , electrical equipment , and rubber . Meanwhile , actual and potential disruptions of natural gas supplies are contributing to uncertainties in parts of the District . Our survey of District retailers yields much the same picture .

Banking directors report that businessmen , on balance , are attempting to reduce their reliance on bank loans . Firms are still issuing medium and long-term debt to improve the structure of their balance sheets . Bankers are particularly disappointed by the lack of demand for inventory financing .

But even stronger demand for construction materials may not help the steel industry because as much as three-fourths of the current production of some firms goes into oil field equipment manufacturing which is now beginning to soften . In addition , aluminum output continues at the low level established last summer . Domestic drilling activity has taken a turn for the worse . After reaching a 14-year high in late December , the total number of active rotary drilling rigs dropped 16 percent to a 17-month low in March . A seasonal decline in drilling is expected in the first quarter of each year ; but according to some industry spokesmen , the cutback was also in response to a rollback in the average price of domestic crude oil to $ 7.66 a barrel—down from the January high of $ 8.43 . Many drilling contractors expect the decline to slow and drilling to begin a seasonal upswing in the last half of the year . However , the future is clouded by proposed legislation that is unfavorable to the industry . Despite the sharp drop in rig count , more wells were completed in the first quarter of 1976 than in the comparable period last year .

Given the evidence of increased cattle placements in feedlots during the fourth quarter , together with the beginning of an expansion in hog farrowings , meat supplies in 1976 promise to be large enough to offer some stability to retail prices—assuming that the farm-to-retail margins do not widen significantly . The winter wheat situation in the District is still hanging in the balance due to the lack of moisture . Several stories of farmers abandoning the crop , taking steps to prevent wind erosion where there is no wheat , and applying for disaster payments have been reported in the news media . However , a large crop is still possible if the weather cooperates over the next few months . And , if crop producers follow through with their intentions as reported in January , the production of most crops in 1976 will likely be large enough to restrain any sharp rise in prices .

All auto dealers surveyed by this bank reported better sales than in 1974 's depressed fourth quarter . Increases ranged from 8 percent to better than 100 percent . Buyers showed renewed interest in both intermediate and full-sized models . Inventories of automobiles on dealer lots were being kept at normal or low levels . There was little evidence of recovery in the District 's manufacturing sector . Manufacturing employment bottomed out in June 1975 and has been virtually flat since then . Nonetheless , survey results indicate that manufacturing sales expectations are improving . The overall employment picture was somewhat brighter than in the manufacturing sector . Since June , employment has been increasing steadily . Nonetheless , the year-end unemployment rate remained high due to labor force fluctuations .

120,"their responses in April , when only 31 percent reported low spending and 25 percent expected more low spending for the next quarter . Most directors reported quite strong residential construction activity but mostly in just the single-family market . A director whose firm is a major producer of temperature controls cited information indicating that single-family construction was much stronger in the Ninth District than in the nation . He expected that strength to increase in the third quarter . With regard to apartment building , he mentioned a national association of home builders survey , which found a rather sharp second-quarter recovery in multifamily construction that was expected to gain momentum during the remainder of 1976 and into 1977 . Also , a recent Twin Cities metropolitan area apartment survey reported that vacancy rates had declined to quite a low level , a usual sign that a pickup is due . However , many observers felt that rental rates were not high enough to justify new apartment construction in the District . Reports from directors on building activity in their respective areas showed nonresidential construction weaker than residential construction .

Nearly every District focuses attention on the strength of consumer demand as an indication that the economy may be regaining some of the momentum it lost in the latter months of 1975 . The picture is still far from rosy , but the outlook is distinctly more optimistic . Even though capital goods industries are still weak , the rest of the manufacturing sector is gaining strength . Inventories have been brought into line with sales and new orders are up . Two persistent weak spots—the construction industry 's slump and high urban unemployment—remain gloomy , but inflationary pressures seem to be moderating in several Districts . While there is little disagreement that `` catch-up '' efforts in wage negotiations scheduled for 1976 pose a problem for stabilizing production costs , there are differences of opinion on the likelihood that food prices will rise significantly during the next few months . The financial sector continues to build liquidity rather than expand . Savings are flowing into commercial banks and thrift institutions at very rapid rates . This is putting downward pressure on mortgage rates . However , despite low interest rates for business loans , demand for credit remains sluggish . Reports from 10 of the 12 Districts indicate that the surge of retail sales experienced in December was no fluke .

129,"September 15 , 1976 Judging from our latest survey of Fifth District business conditions , the level of activity among manufacturers showed little change in the past month . The level of shipments , in fact , has remained essentially unchanged since June , while the volume of new orders has registered minimal declines in each of the past 3 months . Backlogs of orders and finished goods inventories are down somewhat from July , and stocks of materials are reported to have risen slightly since then . Manufacturing inventories remain somewhat above desired levels as does current plant and equipment capacity . Retailers apparently experienced some improvement in sales during August , but at least one respondent attributes this to heavy price markdowns . Sales of big-ticket items continue to lag relative to total sales . Demand for bank loans remains soft . In the agricultural sector , dry weather for the past several weeks has damaged pastures and most major crops in wide areas of the District . Survey responses of District manufacturers exhibit much the same pattern as in the past 2 months , suggesting a stable level of shipments , some weakness in the volume of new orders , and a small decline in order backlogs .

While capital equipment output appears to be rising overall , demand for heavy capital goods related to capacity expansion remains sluggish . Sales of most types of farm equipment are running below last year . Heavy trucks , trailers , light construction equipment , and various components are relatively strong . Sales of energy-related equipment are good , but not up to expectations . Orders for machine tools , especially those for auto companies , are well above last year and further gains are expected in 1978 . Recent declines in crop prices have caused concern at district agricultural banks .

He does not believe that the rapid rate of increase in retail sales last month can be sustained , nor is it consistent with forecasts of only 4-to-5 % quarterly gains",-0.2,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:33:01.5158891Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.2}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 10020, 1432, 879, 842, 2387, 3620, 392, 16438, 369, 9445, 9182, 2420, 5489, 460, 865, 7191, 2747, 1395, 1938, 467, 900, 28713, 297, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28734, 28733, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28740, 304, 3909, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28784, 1200, 297, 18879, 302, 272, 1639, 369, 16298, 349, 25013, 4337, 821, 297, 1395, 15772, 842, 9321, 487, 304, 14553, 9182, 2420, 3336, 486, 624, 5799, 460, 5745, 298, 347, 438, 396, 544, 28733, 1536, 1486, 304, 622, 3917, 347, 3119, 842, 11549, 450, 5503, 304, 5135, 20252, 21781, 3688, 438, 6157, 1162, 2747, 264, 879, 3584, 1200, 5432, 624, 1792, 17171, 5745, 264, 3210, 268, 11552, 13388, 297, 5135, 20252, 21781, 1938, 3628, 842, 1418, 272, 799, 1021, 1200, 1255, 425, 380, 304, 12899, 840, 10624, 21781, 460, 865, 7191, 2747, 1432, 879, 464, 28713, 6157, 304, 390, 268, 1564, 22862, 622, 10596, 6503, 298, 5247, 1395, 21781, 842, 6055, 734, 304, 10755, 5363, 395, 12077, 11282, 460, 9430, 297, 652, 8044, 684, 26140, 354, 12077, 9981, 842, 4127, 2070, 6292, 21722, 297, 3628, 654, 2475, 7986, 298, 264, 879, 5585, 1200, 741, 11603, 404, 6344, 13831, 925, 842, 330, 6859, 302, 264, 9784, 4143, 7650, 13831, 594, 369, 25642, 21722, 297, 7904, 304, 396, 10214, 27301, 1907, 1486, 19938, 302, 27040, 279, 1238, 354, 4607, 28538, 304, 17211, 28733, 1123, 11282, 682, 3917, 2400, 1060, 3437, 12077, 9981, 842, 1094, 3620, 392, 297, 11603, 6226, 28190, 25642, 6057, 297, 12761, 522, 7904, 304, 7483, 3327, 14285, 7978, 622, 2400, 7544, 21722, 297, 1353, 12077, 27040, 279, 1238, 298, 684, 264, 28705, 28770, 1239, 9558, 4338, 302, 5247, 456, 2795, 842, 650, 1235, 459, 3091, 369, 272, 8421, 4338, 302, 5247, 297, 11603, 6292, 1432, 2102, 541, 347, 25859, 1200, 4678, 349, 378, 10652, 395, 19912, 28713, 302, 865, 28705, 28781, 28733, 532, 28733, 28782, 1239, 8249, 346, 21722, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 387, 28734, 28723, 28750, 28752], 'total_duration': 2561169700, 'load_duration': 6409400, 'prompt_eval_count': 375, 'prompt_eval_duration': 991173000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1560738000}"

Residential construction remains strong , while nonresidential construction activity is making a year-end surge . But industry spokesmen predict a slowing in construction activity by mid-1978 . The demand for home mortgages remains very active , but savings and loan associations suggest market demands will slow in coming months .

144,"planting is running on or ahead of schedule , and in the southern part of the District the wheat has germinated and is beginning to grow . According to one director from an agricultural area , the quality of the wheat stand is excellent and the crop prospects for the coming year are `` very good when compared with this time last year . '' If the new crop continues to receive rain , wheat pasture will be available for grazing and some ranchers will probably take advantage of this cheap source of feed . Thus , prices for light cattle may strengthen as a result of this activity . Because most farmers were uncertain about the details of the new farm program when they started planting their wheat , acreage in the District 's major producing states is expected to be about equal to 1977 levels . However , as farmers become more familiar with the program , some of the crop will probably be destroyed so that their eligibility for full Government benefits will not be jeopardized . This strategy may be employed because , with the huge stocks of wheat now on hand , the price outlook for the coming year is not bright for producers . Most Tenth District bankers contacted report strong loan demand , especially in energy-related businesses and in real estate loans , both residential and commercial .

Capital spending , on the other hand , continues generally weak , with a quite visible portion of this spending being used for pollution control . Residential construction remains strong , though the rate of increase has plateaued in most areas . Because of low grain prices and high drought-induced production costs , many Western farmers are experiencing serious cash-flow problems and rural economies are somewhat depressed . The much-noted forest fires of the west have been mainly confined to wilderness and park areas and are unlikely to have any noticeable impact on the timber supply .

155,"this higher level of activity has continued into April . A representative of a major chemical company noted that demand has remained strong for most products with the exception of a slight reduction in demand for some fibers . Representatives of other manufacturing concerns , such as apparel , paper , beer , food products , appliances and consumer tools , indicate a continuing growth in demand . Orders and production in several capital goods industries have picked up in the past couple of months , although reporters point out that boom conditions have not developed . Orders for large electrical motors , thermostats and other control devices , industrial screws and bolts , fabricated products , railroad cars , and industrial lubricating equipment were reported to have increased recently . Representatives of the aircraft industry also reported a high level of activity . On the other hand , orders for such items as telecommunications equipment , farm equipment , and radiators for heavy equipment were reported to have remained relatively stable . While recent gains have occurred in the capital goods industry , the general consensus among businessmen is that the President 's energy proposals will have adverse effects on capital spending in the near term . It is the businessmen 's view that the proposals have created more uncertainty , and hence , have increased the difficulty of predicting costs .

Construction activity and prospects remain strong . Credit demands are hefty , with sources of loanable funds generally adequate . Farm product prices have softened ; dry weather and labor shortages have made trouble for crop producers . Retail sales remain generally strong , but directors in several areas reported a moderation in late June , particularly in sales of big-ticket items .

Houthakker believes intervention may occasionally be necessary when market conditions become disorderly as may have been the case in the early days of the new year . Further intervention , however , is not necessary and not in the best interests of the United States . Lower import prices would help meet Germany 's and Japan 's concern about inflation and provide them with more elbow room to pursue expansionary policies . Although declines in the dollar do contribute to our inflation , the magnitude of the impact so far is one we can live with . Unlike 1972 and 1973 , the rise in the prices of our imports have not been accompanied by sharp increases in the price of exported goods . Tobin does not object to short-run intervention to stabilize irrational day-to-day speculation but does oppose trying to peg the exchange rate . Tobin doubts that the dollar would be overvalued if Germany and Japan were operating at reasonable levels of capacity , and questions whether it is overvalued anyway . Recent declines reflect portfolio shifts by OPEC investors that have little to do with the fundamental value of the dollar .

The coal strike began to register an adverse impact on output in late February , but this influence is still relatively minor , and largely confined to Indiana . Some retailers are very pleased with recent sales , but others are not . There is evidence that consumers are holding back on purchases of autos and other big ticket items . Business capital outlays are expected to rise this year , both for equipment and structures . Demand for farm equipment is conspicuously weak . The long severe winter has hampered construction activity to an abnormal degree . Demand for credit appears to be strengthening , especially for bank loans to larger businesses . Interest rates are expected to move at least moderately higher as demand for credit increases while savings inflows to Thrift institutions remain slow . Knowledgeable business managers in the district believe that the coal strike negotiations have been `` bungled . '' The pact presented to the miners for ratification took away some benefits won earlier , and attempted to place unacceptable penalties on wildcat strikes .

All directors report that Christmas sales met or exceeded retailers ' high expectations . A few directors describe seasonal sales as `` strong , '' `` pretty good , '' and '' remarkably good . '' Severe weather in North Dakota reduced sales from what they otherwise would have been , but even there , retailers are described as `` happy . '' Our surveys are consistent with these observations . Some retailers are reporting sales for December as 10 to 30 percent over a year ago .

However , the view that inventories are too high is widely held among manufacturers in the Richmond District . Residential construction remains strong , according to those reports that comment on this sector . Atlanta perceives an acceleration in the pace of such construction , led by single-family units but with quickening of the rate at which apartment projects are coming on stream as vacancies dwindle and rents climb . St. Louis reports home building to be strong , with recent home sales in some areas of the District the largest in several years for the winter season . Minneapolis notes that home building in its District has remained well above the previous record pace of 1972 , and is expected to remain strong in the coming months , while housing experts in the Chicago District also believe home building will be strong again in 1978 . Regarding business capital outlays , Chicago reports that the demand for most types of capital goods has continued in a modest uptrend , and that a majority of purchasing agents in areas heavily emphasizing capital goods production expect improved conditions this year .

Similarly , capital goods producers in the Cleveland District expect business to be as good or better this year than in 1977 , with a sharp step-up in capital spending in the aerospace and communication industries .

Generally , hard goods and automobiles are selling well , but sales of seasonal merchandise , including summer apparel and air conditioning units , have been sluggish or below expectations .

171,", but these shortages were not expected to affect production . Plant managers , mechanics and mold makers were also cited as specialized skills that were in relative tight supply by one director . For the most part , retail sales in May and early June were judged to have been on target . Nevertheless , for the year as a whole , several merchants felt that sales were below expectations . As a consequence , retailers viewed their inventories as somewhat high , but voiced little concern over their ability to work off any excesses once the summer sales season rolled into gear . Automotive sales have been brisk in recent months . One industry economist attributed the current spurt to a combination of `` catch-up '' buying after the past winter and consumers attempt to beat price increases due on the new model year cars . Thus , he expected sales to taper off considerably later in the summer . Outside of the retail sector , the outlook for capital spending in the District appears to have strengthened . The president of a major utility reported that his firm was experiencing record growth that , in turn , was triggering an increase in capital spending plans . Reports from the directors of the Buffalo branch suggested a noticeable brightening in the outlook . A major Rochester firm has commenced construction of a major facility . At the same time , several manufacturing firms in Buffalo are going ahead with planned plant expansions .

None of the retailers contacted has assumed a tax cut in his forecast . Local bankers say loan demand remains generally strong this month . Consumer loans continue to grow and C & I loans are reported to be 1 to 7 percent over year-end figures . Business loan demand is slightly ahead of planned levels overall . Bankers contacted say they have seen the underlying demand for business loans grow slowly and steadily over the past several months , so that unconventional loans are less necessary . As for the future , bankers look for continued strength in loan demand over the next two quarters . One contact feels that part of this continuing demand growth will come from the retailing sector .

173,"March 15 , 1978 Retail sales are reported strong in most parts of the District , though the coal strike in Utah and heavy rains in Southern California have weakened sales somewhat . The inventory picture is mixed with some excess inventories reported in Southern California due to rain-depressed sales and thin inventories in the Pacific Northwest due to slow shipments of goods from the Northeast . Western industry continues to grow , with aluminum and aerospace doing particularly well . While consumer and real estate loan demand remains strong , business loan demand is still flat . While retail sales in Northern California appear to be running up to 12 percent above year-ago levels , sales in Southern California have been dampened by unusually heavy and frequent rains . Grocery stores in that area report sales to be both less than last year and less than planned . Retail sales of non-durables in the Los Angeles area are very slow due to bad weather , and year-to-year declines of 10 percent in weekly volumes are not unusual .

However , such shortages are not viewed by homebuilders as an insurmountable problem and apprentice programs are bulging . Homebuilders are beginning to express some fear about a sharp decline in home demand in the future .

Employment throughout the District is fairly steady so far , but many contacts believe unemployment will trend upward in the coming months . Additionally , new Comprehensive Employment Training Act regulations that limit CETA employment to 18 months , effective October 1 , and heavy federal budget cuts will nudge unemployment even higher at a time of anticipated slow economic activity . For example , more than 1,500 CETA workers in Atlanta are expected to be laid off by the end of the year and 182 are scheduled to lose their jobs in East Baton Rouge Parish . After appreciable declines for June and July , attendance at many attractions showed reassuring increases in August . Tourists dealt with higher gasoline prices by continuing to visit attractions within a shorter driving range . Campground business remains very weak throughout the District because of a reluctance to travel too far with gas-guzzling recreational vehicles . Abundant rainfall throughout the District has enhanced yield prospects for crops , particularly soybeans , corn , peanuts , and cotton , and improved pastures . Resultant higher quality pastures helped maintain the good physical condition of cattle herds during the hot summer months .

All three respondents agreed that the moderate third quarter rebound does not signal the end of the recession , although there is disagreement about the appropriate course for monetary policy at the present time . They are puzzled about the recent turmoil in the foreign exchange , gold , and commodity markets , and they offer conflicting advice on how to deal with it . Professor Eckstein believes that the third quarter 's growth was achieved at the cost of a more severe downturn in the months ahead . He expects inflation to continue near its current pace for several more months , however , despite the imminent slowdown . In Eckstein ' s view , the decline of the dollar on foreign exchange markets is primarily the result of domestic economic performance .

The strength in auto sales , which was induced by rebates , may have come at the expense of fourth-quarter sales , according to some officials . Durable goods manufacturing has tended to hold up better than had been expected , partly because housing and related industries have been better than expected . However , a supplier to the appliance industry reports that orders have tended to weaken and backlogs reduced in recent weeks . An economist for an aluminum producer views the decline in orders for packaging materials as an indication of a further slowdown . Finally , a retailer believes some softness in overall business sales stems from tight control over inventories , and hence new orders , by retailers . Capital goods producers , except for auto and truck-related industries , report that business has been buoyed by a need for additional facilities , and production is expected to remain strong in the fourth quarter .

Borrowers generally expect that inflationary price increases will continue to outpace interest costs .",0.3,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:35:04.2489809Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 28277, 28724, 1200, 395, 264, 2475, 19930, 302, 9039, 2632, 842, 415, 2668, 354, 28123, 297, 369, 2698, 10352, 298, 347, 1215, 6975, 842, 1450, 1611, 6380, 297, 23672, 349, 805, 684, 28705, 28770, 28734, 4153, 477, 264, 879, 3584, 1200, 562, 1843, 28733, 411, 27357, 8383, 460, 582, 28705, 28784, 28734, 4153, 754, 1432, 5561, 464, 28713, 10389, 842, 6318, 24715, 464, 28713, 11821, 8383, 460, 805, 28705, 28781, 28734, 298, 28705, 28782, 28734, 4153, 477, 879, 28733, 3584, 6157, 842, 2909, 9039, 297, 272, 3268, 864, 2698, 1200, 724, 5200, 297, 272, 429, 28705, 28740, 28734, 28734, 28725, 28734, 28734, 28734, 298, 429, 28705, 28740, 28750, 28782, 28725, 28734, 28734, 28734, 1170, 9170, 1200, 506, 7568, 356, 272, 2668, 354, 582, 298, 264, 879, 842, 330, 3944, 3254, 349, 835, 14885, 297, 19301, 464, 28713, 2692, 28733, 12483, 11821, 2668, 1200, 562, 6079, 28733, 12483, 11821, 10352, 2967, 842, 23501, 272, 28705, 28740, 28750, 362, 8207, 1200, 12095, 297, 5206, 14219, 288, 506, 750, 11510, 286, 486, 20767, 1955, 6355, 304, 20613, 28821, 293, 1162, 390, 272, 12595, 352, 302, 5317, 20613, 842, 1015, 456, 20613, 628, 6403, 349, 13098, 8689, 298, 7725, 1055, 1395, 5565, 4907, 369, 590, 1675, 298, 927, 354, 11120, 304, 28748, 271, 12832, 297, 272, 3437, 842, 365, 6300, 404, 6741, 1675, 369, 20613, 628, 4144, 12095, 622, 3688, 298, 575, 2644, 2145, 6966, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28770, 28752], 'total_duration': 2423256200, 'load_duration': 5618300, 'prompt_eval_count': 297, 'prompt_eval_duration': 834217000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1580694000}"
190,"January 31 , 1979 The Western economy continues to grow , but several weak spots have begun to develop . While department store sales continue strong , auto sales have declined in most areas of the District . A decline in residential construction is being partially offset by an increase in commercial construction . Labor shortages have emerged in a number of areas . Loan demand is weakening in some areas , though non-real estate loan demand appears to continue strong in many parts of the District . While there is little information available on post-Christmas sales , the Christmas season itself was characterized by strong and sometimes unexpectedly strong growth in department store sales . One Oregon department store noted a 15-20 percent increase in December sales over last year . Merchants in two Washington counties reported record Christmas sales , some exceeding last year by 25 percent . While other areas reported similarly strong sales , at least one observer noted that merchants were approaching 1979 with caution and keeping a sharp eye on inventories . Auto sales , on the other hand , have slowed considerably throughout the District . In Salt Lake City , dealers reported a significant drop in new car sales in December . In Oregon , dealers reported special resistance to `` new models which are higher in price and smaller in appearance . ''

Central Washington reports a slight falling off in auto sales and while booming Seattle reports continued excellent auto sales , this is composed of",0.3,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:35:06.823176Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 21650, 4084, 28705, 28770, 28740, 1200, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28774, 415, 8307, 8725, 10352, 298, 2333, 1200, 562, 2856, 6334, 16961, 506, 13724, 298, 1950, 842, 4023, 9784, 4143, 6292, 3688, 2967, 1200, 4027, 6292, 506, 23043, 297, 1080, 5020, 302, 272, 8207, 842, 330, 17468, 297, 18350, 6380, 349, 1250, 19966, 4470, 486, 396, 5247, 297, 7380, 6380, 842, 14160, 2485, 1291, 506, 16188, 297, 264, 1474, 302, 5020, 842, 7300, 276, 5637, 349, 478, 2589, 288, 297, 741, 5020, 1200, 2070, 1843, 28733, 6487, 9490, 9976, 5637, 8045, 298, 3688, 2967, 297, 1287, 5099, 302, 272, 8207, 842, 4023, 736, 349, 1628, 1871, 2632, 356, 1704, 28733, 17701, 4876, 6292, 1200, 272, 7416, 3302, 3837, 403, 23100, 486, 2967, 304, 4662, 12799, 346, 2967, 6057, 297, 9784, 4143, 6292, 842, 2387, 19301, 9784, 4143, 8659, 264, 28705, 28740, 28782, 28733, 28750, 28734, 4153, 5247, 297, 4925, 6292, 754, 1432, 879, 842, 5625, 338, 1549, 297, 989, 5924, 2113, 497, 5745, 2395, 7416, 6292, 1200, 741, 12436, 288, 1432, 879, 486, 28705, 28750, 28782, 4153, 842, 4023, 799, 5020, 5745, 21922, 2967, 6292, 1200, 438, 2429, 624, 21854, 8659, 369, 18724, 1549, 654, 19940, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28787, 28774, 395, 26769, 304, 7603, 264, 10227, 5421, 356, 9182, 2420, 842, 12191, 6292, 1200, 356, 272, 799, 1021, 1200, 506, 28636, 25013, 5473, 272, 8207, 842, 560, 21943, 8703, 3805, 1200, 3215, 404, 5745, 264, 5864, 6088, 297, 633, 1253, 6292, 297, 4925, 842, 560, 19301, 1200, 3215, 404, 5745, 2841, 12568, 298, 5008, 633, 4994, 690, 460, 4337, 297, 4144, 304, 7000, 297, 9293, 842, 9842, 13, 13, 18503, 1650, 5924, 7959, 264, 5543, 10931, 805, 297, 4027, 6292, 304, 1312, 1359, 17846, 18083, 7959, 5317, 8099, 4027, 6292, 1200, 456, 349, 15021, 302, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28770, 28752], 'total_duration': 2571521400, 'load_duration': 5637700, 'prompt_eval_count': 361, 'prompt_eval_duration': 972224000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1590658000}"

Lending at most S & L 's and commercial banks is showing slight response to declining interest rates . Manufacturing output is soft , with some improvement in orders from suppliers to the construction industry .

Credit sales are rebounding from the low level following March 14 but remains a smaller proportion of total sales than in the previous year . Department stores continue to rely heavily on sales and promotions to generate store traffic and move merchandise . Inventory levels are generally described as desirable , although a few retailers have excess stock where sales have not met projections .

199,". Recent sales have been helped by an increased availability of funds at GMAC and Ford Motor Credit Company . The number of auto loans are also up a bit at a number of District banks . Bankers report many inquiries for terms on auto loans , but most are reluctant to borrow at the prevailing 14.5- percent annual rate . The decline in interest rates has reduced inventory costs for dealers , but weak sales forced the bankruptcy of a major Dallas Ford dealer last month . The outlook for residential construction has improved slightly . Inventories of unsold new homes are not excessive . Sales of both new and used homes have picked up slightly in the last two months with the decline in mortgage rates and increased availability of municipal bond funding in the District . Corporate relocations to this area also continue to bolster sales . However , the revival in home sales is not yet significant , as some home purchases are being delayed as many potential buyers anticipate further declines in mortgage rates . Prices are reported to be firm , with substantial discounts generally not available .

The district 's corn and soybean crops , however , could still be quite good if they get adequate moisture in August . In spite of the drought , farm income in the district has stopped falling . This is mainly because the prices that farmers are getting for their products leaped between June and July .

202,"March 11 , 1980 The REDBOOK reports this month indicate that business activity is holding quite steady in most districts , with few widespread signs of weakness . High technology and defense-related industries are performing particularly well . The major exceptions to this pattern are the housing and automobile industries , which are exhibiting considerable weakness . Most districts report very strong volumes of retail sales—a phenomenon which several reports ascribed to a pervasive `` spend it now '' psychology on the part of consumers . Reports of continued inflation are also widespread . With the exception of home mortgages , loan volumes were reported to be strong in most districts prior to the recent runup in rates . Spotty current reports indicate a subsequent weakening of loan demand . Financial institutions are experiencing considerable conversion of savings deposits into money-market liabilities , and there is widespread concern about the consequent effect on the cost of funds and institutional profitability . The agricultural sector is apparently in good shape in most districts . Most districts report generally strong industrial activity . New York , for example , reports brisk new orders and generally steady activity .

205,"December 16 , 1981 Manufacturing in the First District has weakened over the past month and a half . Many more firms than usual have announced shutdowns over the Christmas season . The retail situation is more difficult to assess ; since Thanksgiving , sales have been strong in some areas , weak in others . Also , last year the Christmas season began slowly but ended on a strong note and the season as a whole was quite good ; it is impossible to tell yet if this is happening again . Retailers are somewhat concerned about inventory levels ; most manufacturers , despite the recent downturn , do not view inventories as a problem . The housing market remains weak , but mortgage rates are now beginning to fall . Until Thanksgiving , New England retail sales in November continued to reflect the weakening economy . As a result , inventories are higher than planned . Since Thanksgiving , retailing has been very mixed . Some areas are showing unexpected strength , and in others , sales have fallen well below the usual seasonal levels . The picture in Massachusetts is complicated by a heavy weekend snowstorm that closed most stores for a day . One merchant cites particular strength in sales of high quality goods , partly a result of that firm 's efforts to attract more high income customers and partly because the recession is affecting high income shoppers less .

206,"ahead to 1982 , the executives were almost unanimous in forecasting an improved year at home but only half expected an upturn abroad . One positive development in this month 's reports is evidence of further progress in bringing down the rate of inflation . Only a third of purchasing managers surveyed reported prices increased in the past month ; earlier in the year and for most of 1980 , two-thirds normally reported higher prices . Commodity prices have softened and are expected to remain soft for some time . Not everyone is happy about lower prices : the building materials executive reports that although costs are up , his firm has been forced to price its products below 1980 levels . Professors Houthakker and Samuelson were available for comment this month . Houthakker is disappointed that fiscal policy for 1982 will not reduce the budget deficit , and he sympathizes somewhat with our foreign trading partners who object to domestic policies . Nevertheless , he believes there is no need to change monetary policy at this time . Houthakker recommends a temporary shift of attention to M-2 if a conflict should arise between attaining the M-2 guideline and the M-1B guideline . Once the NOW account adjustment is complete and the M-2 and M-1B guidelines are once again mutually consistent , the Fed should return its attention to M-1B . Houthakker wonders how much of recent M-2 growth is due to the increase in money market mutual fund balances .

209,". Rising interest rates should not be a deterrent to economic activity , according to a bank economist , unless record interest rates are reached . Overall manufacturing activity , as measured by the Fourth District 's Survey of Manufacturing , is expected to continue to expand into the second quarter , based on strength in new orders , shipments and employment . However , a loss of momentum is also suggested by the reduction in the number of firms expecting increases in each of these indexes , except shipments , during April . Prices Moderation in the first quarter GNP implicit price deflator has not altered inflation expectations . Decelerating prices , anticipated by several Roundtable economists , have been enhanced by rebate programs in the auto industry and declining demand for gasoline . While most items except energy increased at a reduced rate in the first quarter of 1981 , the underlying inflation rate remains about 9 % -10 % , according to an auto economist . A producer of consumer nondurables expects meat prices to increase during the summer , following the stepped-up slaughtering of cattle in recent weeks . Food prices in general may be helped by expected good weather , but rising costs could lead to upward pressures on prices by year-end . A trade economist expects inflation to move below double-digit rates by the end of the year , but he also expects slower progress over the longer term because of the insensitivity of wage costs .

212,"January 28 , 1981 Overview Business conditions in the Tenth District continue to show little strength . Softness in retail sales is expected to continue for a while , and the short-term outlook for auto sales is viewed as poor . Inventories of retailers and manufacturers are higher than desired . The winter wheat crop is in some danger due to lack of moisture . Loan demand at commercial banks has weakened recently , with loans to the energy industry an exception . Retail Sales and Inventories Most Tenth District retailers indicate that total dollar sales in 1980 were 5-10 per cent greater than in 1979 . But sales in December 1980 and January 1981 have not shown that much strength in most areas of the District . Sales have been strongest in durable goods and higher priced items , primarily quality apparel . Most retailers expect the current softness of total sales to continue , at least through the first and second quarters . A majority of retailers continue to report negligible merchandise cost increases in recent months are reducing upward pressure on retail prices . Most retailers note recent downward pressure on profit margins because of increases in advertising expenditures , utility bills , and other operational expenses . The recent weakness in total dollar sales leaves most retailers in the Tenth District with inventory levels that are slightly higher than desirable . However , none of the retailers report any plans for extra clearance sales in January or February .

The district is also being adversely affected by several other labor disputes . Since mid-July , 14,000 State of Minnesota workers have been on strike , reducing state services . In addition , labor disputes between residential builders and carpenters and between foundries and workers have been slowing down construction and manufacturing activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area .

222,"large iron mining company recalled about 1,800 workers in early March , another laid off 2,100 workers for eight weeks . Besides that , energy production , which had long been a source of strength for the district , weakened recently . Due to the glut in petroleum supplies , oil exploration slowed at the western end of the district . A Montana director said that in early March 100 oil rigs were idle in eastern Montana and western North Dakota . Directors also said that the forest products industry at both ends of the district remained very depressed . Agricultural Conditions Recent changes in the prices of farm products indicate possible recovery for about half the district 's farmers—those who produce livestock—but not for the other half . Between January and early March , the prices farmers receive for hogs and cattle at South St. Paul rose about 7 percent . One director attributed part of the rise to unusually harsh winter weather restricting the flow of livestock to market . But the price rise may not be as temporary as that explanation would indicate : an economist associated with the livestock industry attributed part of the rise to livestock herds being smaller than anticipated . Crop farmers have n't had to face this ambiguity about their price situation . Cash crop prices at Minneapolis were essentially unchanged between January and early March , and they were considerably below their year-earlier levels . Weak demand seemed to be keeping these prices down , for the",-0.5,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:36:30.3739271Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.5}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 16962, 8075, 15121, 2496, 16831, 684, 28705, 28740, 28725, 28783, 28734, 28734, 7433, 297, 2935, 4117, 1200, 1698, 10535, 805, 28705, 28750, 28725, 28740, 28734, 28734, 7433, 354, 5435, 4587, 842, 14862, 369, 1200, 3408, 4885, 1200, 690, 553, 1043, 750, 264, 2832, 302, 6342, 354, 272, 7181, 1200, 6334, 2106, 5915, 842, 16043, 298, 272, 1272, 329, 297, 5408, 9606, 383, 13679, 1200, 5503, 23083, 28636, 438, 272, 12772, 948, 302, 272, 7181, 842, 330, 5684, 2238, 6859, 773, 369, 297, 2935, 4117, 28705, 28740, 28734, 28734, 5503, 10536, 28713, 654, 25282, 297, 16495, 5684, 2238, 304, 12772, 3964, 27266, 842, 6055, 734, 835, 773, 369, 272, 8613, 4076, 4779, 438, 1560, 9675, 302, 272, 7181, 7568, 1215, 27696, 842, 23837, 1890, 11884, 2065, 27727, 4435, 297, 272, 8506, 302, 6354, 4076, 11634, 2572, 12106, 354, 684, 2795, 272, 7181, 464, 28713, 17130, 28821, 362, 645, 693, 7072, 9678, 374, 629, 28821, 2391, 459, 354, 272, 799, 2795, 842, 18046, 4624, 304, 2935, 4117, 1200, 272, 8506, 17130, 5556, 354, 295, 22990, 304, 23137, 438, 3658, 662, 28723, 3920, 8536, 684, 28705, 28787, 4153, 842, 2387, 6859, 26133, 744, 302, 272, 8418, 298, 12449, 1323, 18138, 8539, 8086, 8336, 288, 272, 4699, 302, 9678, 374, 629, 298, 2668, 842, 1092, 272, 4144, 8418, 993, 459, 347, 390, 13415, 390, 369, 13268, 682, 11634, 714, 396, 3620, 392, 5363, 395, 272, 9678, 374, 629, 4779, 26133, 744, 302, 272, 8418, 298, 9678, 374, 629, 559, 3673, 1250, 7000, 821, 25024, 842, 334, 1506, 17130, 506, 307, 28742, 28707, 553, 298, 2105, 456, 25787, 25239, 684, 652, 4144, 4620, 842, 23439, 21948, 8506, 438, 3197, 485, 20389, 654, 13315, 521, 11247, 1444, 4624, 304, 2935, 4117, 1200, 304, 590, 654, 25013, 3624, 652, 879, 28733, 644, 28714, 749, 6157, 842, 816, 491, 5637, 3593, 298, 347, 7603, 1167, 8506, 1060, 1200, 354, 272, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 387, 28734, 28723, 28782, 28752], 'total_duration': 2759818900, 'load_duration': 6627400, 'prompt_eval_count': 377, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1006176000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1744649000}"
223,"December 15 , 1982 Overview Economic activity in most Districts showed some signs of improvement except in the manufacturing sector . Weakness in manufacturing remained pervasive with some further layoffs reported and , for the most part , little or no upturn in new orders . Consumer spending strengthened in November but several Districts noted sluggish early-December sales . Housing sales and starts registered gains in most regions although the oversupply of office space kept nonresidential construction generally slow . In several agricultural areas a further decline in farm income and land values overshadowed the few bright spots that appeared . Commercial bank lending was essentially flat in most reporting Districts . The general outlook ranges from a slight upturn during the next six months to little pickup until late 1983 . Consumer Spending Since the last report , consumer expenditures posted some gains on both a month-to-month and year-over-year basis , helped in part by promotional activity . Nonetheless , no real exuberance was displayed . Auto sales picked up in several areas in response to lower finance charges but these lower rates are scheduled to end soon . With regard to the overall outlook for retail sales during the holiday season , the most optimistic report was from Boston ( `` solid but unspectacular '' ) . Several Districts experienced good consumer buying immediately after Thanksgiving but sluggish sales thereafter .

One factor cited was the trend in recent years of a shift in sales to the end of the holiday season .

Business liquidity continues to deteriorate ; profits will remain under extreme pressure , while no balance sheet restructuring has materialized during this recession . Many additional downgradings of business credit ratings are likely to be announced in the forthcoming months . Interest rates will continue to be highly volatile . The long-term bond markets in particular will be challenged by a lack of liquidity in business , the huge Treasury cash needs , and a firm monetary policy . Maude : Most likely developments over the spring and early summer months should place renewed severe upward pressure on interest rates with long-term yields retesting their 1981 highs in a financial crisis type environment . These developments should manifest themselves in the form of a highly anemic economic recovery , some modest pick-up in private credit demands , a cash flow squeeze in the nonfinancial corporate sector , continued strains on financial intermediaries , credit quality concerns and a reluctance on the part of investors to make long-term fixed income commitments . The underlying causes of these difficulties should be an April and July surge in money growth , a resulting monetary tightening , huge actual Treasury financing ( especially during the third quarter ) and continued apprehension over the out-year budgetary deficits .

Stone : It is our view that the economy has probably touched bottom and that a few months of relatively slow growth lies ahead .

Shopping center construction in Florida and Louisiana is characterized as steady with good prospects for picking up in the near future . Finance Legislators in Florida and Tennessee have effectively defeated bills to allow interstate banking in their respective states . Proponents of the Florida legislation maintained that interstate banking would provide more capital for loans , expand the state 's tax base , and create some healthy competition . Although tabled , the Florida bill could come up later this year . Advocates of the Tennessee legislation argued that out-of-state acquisition of some local banks would relieve the lack of confidence in the state 's financial industry caused by the failure of United American Bank ( UAB ) . Bankers claim the FDIC 's failure to honor loan participations purchased by Tennessee and Kentucky banks from the now defunct UAB could further weaken some already shaken institutions .

The only bright spot in the housing sector , according to builders and realtors , is an increase in traffic—interested buyers —which began near the end of September , and which may eventually result in actual orders and sales . Vacancy rates in commercial buildings remain extremely high with declines contingent on an improved local economy . Despite this high vacancy rate , construction is continuing on several office building projects throughout the District . Commercial Banking Banks in the Fourth District reduced their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities , state and local government securities and federal funds in recent weeks . An increase in loan demand , in conjunction with a marked slowdown in deposit growth , may explain the reduction in bank investments . Virtually all of the increase in loan volume at district banks was in the commercial and industrial loan category . All categories of deposits were essentially flat .

Inventories of raw materials and finished goods are falling . Firms report a decline in employment in May after two months of increases . Manufacturing of light trucks and automobiles , especially large autos , is strong . Producers of these vehicles and their components report expanding hours and employment , but remain cautious about building inventories . Production of parts for the auto after-market , which remained fairly steady during the recession , is rising slowly . Tire manufacturing is improving mildly . Tire manufacturers report shipments of original equipment auto tires up substantially over last year in line with improved new car sales , while replacement tire shipments are up only slightly .

243,"February 2 , 1983 Overview Business firms in the Tenth District are expecting a slow recovery to get underway during the second or third quarter of 1983 . Recent stable prices are expected to rise slightly as 1983 moves along . Inventories are generally lean and are likely to remain so in the near future . Farmers and agricultural lenders are somewhat more optimistic about conditions in the agricultural sector , due partly to the expected response to the newly announced farm program . Loan demand at commercial banks is generally flat , while deposit growth is up because of strong growth in the new money market deposit accounts . Retail Trade All respondents indicate that nominal sales for 1982 as a whole were slightly higher ( 5 percent or less ) than those in 1981 . Sales in the final quarter of 1982 were between 5 and 10 percent higher than a year earlier . The strength in retail sales has come mainly in soft goods , with big-ticket items still very weak .

Loan activity on the retail side continues to improve , but recent gains are not as strong as earlier in the year . Although consumer lending is now as much as 11 percent ahead of last September , lenders say rising interest rates have taken some of the edge off the demand for consumer loans . Area banking officials foresee gradual improvement in overall lending activity over the next six months .

Most bankers also predict that consumer demand for credit will expand further despite the likelihood of slightly higher interest rates . Many lenders plan to maintain their aggressive marketing posture . The prime rate charged by major Third District banks has risen to 11 percent in September from 10.5 percent in early August .

Most firms say they see more increases in the prices of purchased materials and components . Paper , steel and aluminum were mentioned . Several of the firms contacted have recently increased their own prices . Nevertheless , manufacturers are still very cautious about raising prices and will back off if the increase meets a lot of resistance . According to an automotive supplier , the auto companies are negotiating long-term contracts with price decreases in the first year and very modest increases thereafter . One respondent expressed concern that the wage settlement to be negotiated between GM and the UAW in 1984 will be very large and will set a pattern for other industries .

251,"December 5 , 1984 Summary Total business activity in the Seventh District has been about stable since early this year , having flattened earlier than in the nation . Most District reports suggest relative stability in the months ahead , but concern has been growing that a general deterioration is underway . Auto production has returned to a high level , but only slightly above last year . Steel output has improved since late September , but remains well below the first half rate , and below break-even levels . Machine tool orders are up , mainly from the auto industry . Heavy construction and farm equipment makers , faced with weak markets , are selling off units and closing marginal plants . Cutbacks are occurring in the important health care industry , reversing a long-term expansion . Container loadings on flat cars , which had slowed earlier in the year , slipped significantly in November . Demand for most mechanical capital equipment remains weak . Sales of heavy trucks and trailers have softened recently from high levels . However , surveys show sizable additions to capital outlays next year by the auto and steel industries . Many lines of seasonal retail merchandise are reported moving well , but the 2-year boom in consumer hardgoods apparently has run its course . Retail inventories are viewed as excessive , encouraging price markdowns . Recent declines in paperboard demand partly reflect reduced orders for general merchandise .

Residential construction continues to weaken , while nonresidential construction is expanding",0.1,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:37:44.0546329Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.1}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 3337, 4354, 28705, 28782, 1200, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28783, 28781, 23276, 10711, 1955, 6355, 297, 272, 318, 2883, 28716, 8207, 659, 750, 684, 11311, 1854, 2935, 456, 879, 1200, 2461, 972, 1061, 2106, 5585, 821, 297, 272, 5878, 842, 4822, 8207, 7959, 3397, 7986, 16137, 297, 272, 3370, 6280, 1200, 562, 4368, 659, 750, 6485, 369, 264, 2952, 19211, 1782, 352, 349, 916, 1128, 842, 12191, 4885, 659, 4253, 298, 264, 1486, 2184, 1200, 562, 865, 7191, 2747, 1432, 879, 842, 15874, 3825, 659, 11957, 1854, 3909, 4074, 1200, 562, 7520, 1162, 3624, 272, 907, 2795, 4338, 1200, 304, 3624, 1721, 28733, 8790, 6157, 842, 13253, 3921, 8636, 460, 582, 1200, 11464, 477, 272, 4027, 4779, 842, 27428, 6380, 304, 6354, 7108, 290, 8774, 1200, 12565, 395, 6334, 11574, 1200, 460, 10158, 805, 8007, 304, 12984, 25286, 9923, 842, 18514, 19076, 460, 28265, 297, 272, 2278, 2528, 1656, 4779, 1200, 16876, 288, 264, 1043, 28733, 6590, 11120, 842, 25204, 3442, 742, 356, 7007, 8300, 1200, 690, 553, 28636, 5585, 297, 272, 879, 1200, 15841, 11117, 297, 4349, 842, 4267, 391, 354, 1080, 18832, 5565, 7108, 7520, 6334, 842, 16377, 302, 5917, 22988, 304, 8005, 404, 506, 2664, 2106, 5915, 477, 1486, 6157, 842, 2993, 1200, 28254, 1347, 268, 11552, 967, 2065, 298, 5565, 575, 28714, 748, 1679, 879, 486, 272, 4027, 304, 9445, 17909, 842, 6025, 4715, 302, 3302, 282, 11603, 18724, 391, 864, 460, 5745, 5272, 1162, 1200, 562, 272, 28705, 28750, 28733, 4395, 25157, 297, 12077, 1856, 12684, 28713, 10596, 659, 1482, 871, 2363, 842, 8337, 614, 9182, 2420, 460, 16861, 390, 24213, 1200, 21885, 4144, 1716, 3254, 28713, 842, 27727, 3800, 1303, 297, 3830, 3516, 5637, 19208, 7967, 9397, 8636, 354, 2952, 18724, 391, 864, 842, 13, 13, 1146, 27357, 6380, 10352, 298, 478, 2589, 1200, 1312, 1843, 411, 27357, 6380, 349, 20767, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28740, 28752], 'total_duration': 2583761400, 'load_duration': 4706600, 'prompt_eval_count': 371, 'prompt_eval_duration': 986053000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1590099000}"
252,". District farmers , many in distress because of heavy debts and weak prices , continue to restrict purchases . Recession Fears The plateau in District activity since last spring , coupled with recent declines in factory orders and freight movements , raises the question of an imminent recession . Pressures to reduce or hold down inventories are intense . Our contacts with industries important in the District generally expect relative stability during the rest of 1984 and early 1985—but no precipitous decline . However , some company analysts are warning their managements that the situation is fragile and that a general decline , rather than renewed expansion , is the more likely development . Motor Vehicles Auto makers are planning production at a high level through next year 's first quarter , but with only small gains from year-earlier levels . Weaker auto sales in recent months reflect shortages of popular models . Strikes , unrelated parts shortages , and import quotas have limited supplies . Large `` availability '' premiums are reported on some models , recalling the situation after World War II . Steel Steel production in the Chicago and Detroit areas has improved somewhat from September lows associated with heavy imports , the auto strike , and inventory cutting . However , output remains well below the first half pace . Increasingly . imports have penetrated Midwest markets . usually through steel service centers , often owned by foreign steel producers .

255,"October 23 , 1984 Overview Some moderation continues to be apparent in Tenth District economic activity . While retail sales continue to improve , housing activity and mortgage demand have generally slowed . Inventories of retail goods are slightly larger than desired , while inventories of materials inputs are at satisfactory levels . Price increases have been small , and are expected to continue so . Loan demand is increasing slightly at district banks , while deposits remain unchanged . Yields of fall-harvested crops varied across the district while the newly-planted winter wheat crop is in good condition . Retail Trade Retailers report that year-to-date retail sales are up significantly over a year ago , and that sales continued to improve in the past three months . Inventories are slightly larger than desired for some retailers . However , no major trimming is intended , because most retailers are optimistic about sales through the remainder of the year . Prices remained generally flat in recent months , and no significant increases are anticipated through the remainder of the year . Automobile Sales Automobile dealers throughout the Tenth District continue to report improved sales in 1984 relative to last year . Credit market conditions are satisfactory , and financing is available both for floorplanning and car buyers . Most dealers report smaller inventories due mainly to the 1985 model introductions and partially to the GM strike .

258,"nut and grape acreage in the San Joaquin Valley area of California . Financial Institutions In August , consumer credit ( not seasonally adjusted ) at large banks in the Twelfth District grew at a 24 percent annual rate . This represented the largest monthly increase in 1984 and offset weakness in commercial and real estate lending . A sample of smaller institutions showed similar behavior . These increases continue the pattern of strong consumer loan growth shown earlier this year . Bankers in the region attribute the strength to improved economic conditions which have boosted consumer purchases of new cars and recreational vehicles . While a number of banks also report strength in home equity loans , others have experienced slow to flat demand for those loans as consumers have shifted to use of personal credit lines and credit cards for financing . The forecast for consumer credit remains mixed . Many banks expect these loans to continue to grow rapidly through year-end . However , an even larger number of institutions expect slower growth in personal income and rising interest rates to cause a slowdown in both consumer spending and borrowing . A few of these already have experienced a falloff in consumer loan demand .",0.5,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:38:01.8392932Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.5}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 17964, 304, 847, 1748, 264, 961, 465, 297, 272, 3652, 6081, 19424, 262, 10509, 2698, 302, 6247, 842, 17146, 20929, 594, 560, 3628, 1200, 12077, 6183, 325, 459, 3302, 578, 21875, 1143, 438, 2475, 13283, 297, 272, 5852, 599, 362, 8207, 8108, 438, 264, 28705, 28750, 28781, 4153, 9558, 4338, 842, 851, 10483, 272, 7639, 14890, 5247, 297, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28783, 28781, 304, 4470, 18288, 297, 7380, 304, 1353, 9490, 305, 2570, 842, 330, 7324, 302, 7000, 12638, 6642, 3684, 6174, 842, 2957, 12095, 3688, 272, 5340, 302, 2967, 12077, 9976, 6057, 4894, 5585, 456, 879, 842, 7838, 404, 297, 272, 4424, 6836, 272, 6342, 298, 11957, 6638, 4331, 690, 506, 10974, 286, 12077, 25596, 302, 633, 8300, 304, 937, 267, 1249, 11999, 842, 4023, 264, 1474, 302, 13283, 835, 2264, 6342, 297, 1611, 22851, 15556, 1200, 2663, 506, 8304, 3944, 298, 7007, 5637, 354, 1395, 15556, 390, 13776, 506, 16618, 298, 938, 302, 3327, 6183, 4715, 304, 6183, 8445, 354, 27438, 842, 415, 19912, 354, 12077, 6183, 7520, 9430, 842, 6025, 13283, 1675, 1167, 15556, 298, 3688, 298, 2333, 14099, 1059, 879, 28733, 416, 842, 2993, 1200, 396, 1019, 6084, 1474, 302, 12638, 1675, 25642, 6057, 297, 3327, 7904, 304, 11862, 2145, 7978, 298, 4244, 264, 3944, 3254, 297, 1560, 12077, 9981, 304, 14219, 288, 842, 330, 1664, 302, 1167, 2141, 506, 8304, 264, 2949, 1769, 297, 12077, 9976, 5637, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28782, 28752], 'total_duration': 2426292600, 'load_duration': 7738600, 'prompt_eval_count': 298, 'prompt_eval_duration': 846164000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1569894000}"
259,"October 23 , 1984 Consumer spending continued at a brisk pace during September and early October in the Eighth District , but home sales were down and most other sectors of the economy experienced little change . Expectations by most respondents are that consumer spending will remain strong for the remainder of the year and that manufacturing , transportation and employment will rise moderately , while construction is likely to drift lower . Consumer Spending The greatest strength in District economic activity during September and early October was in retail sales . At six department stores , sales were 8 percent higher than the comparable period a year ago , which was then considered a relatively good sales period . Better quality apparel , sports wear , cosmetics and consumer electronics moved particularly well , while sales of furniture and carpeting were below year-ago levels . At each of three discount stores , sales increases were more than 14 percent above the year-ago pace . Promotions combined with price markdowns were successful in moving merchandise . Auto demand remained strong in most parts of the District during September and early October . In the last week of September , however , sales became somewhat sluggish . Seven dealers reported sales 11 percent higher in September than in the same month a year ago , and early October was nearly as good .

Reflecting the strong demand and a continued shortage of popular models , effective new car prices increased at the retail level .

The region 's traditional industries report mixed results , but remain optimistic about 1985 . Retail Retail sales have slowed recently in the First District . The weakening is not universal , however , hitting some `` upscale '' department stores for example , but not a discount chain , and showing wide geographic variation . The downturn is not substantial , and merchants remain moderately optimistic about 1985 . The shift of Easter from April last year to March this year complicates the interpretation of spring sales figures , but March was not an exceptional month for New England retailers . Apparel and other soft goods—traditional Easter items—sold well during the month , but sales in other areas , including home products , pets and sporting goods were disappointing . Early signs suggest that April is following the March trend , and without Easter the measured increases against April last year will be very small or negative .

First quarter sales ( February through April ) will end higher",0.2,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:38:17.5180945Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.2}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 8149, 28705, 28784, 1200, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28783, 28782, 20451, 6355, 659, 28636, 297, 272, 4205, 8207, 297, 5391, 3370, 842, 415, 3944, 3254, 659, 9894, 297, 1560, 272, 15186, 304, 11603, 23014, 1200, 562, 741, 3235, 18253, 3688, 298, 1347, 15045, 6057, 842, 8337, 614, 404, 464, 6292, 5970, 3624, 2623, 297, 741, 4469, 562, 3688, 298, 12436, 1432, 879, 464, 28713, 6157, 842, 560, 15186, 1200, 272, 4282, 3944, 3254, 297, 4007, 7108, 304, 18518, 659, 750, 1162, 798, 1332, 1200, 304, 1450, 5783, 464, 28713, 1486, 14130, 18253, 506, 750, 3352, 1395, 20998, 14426, 842, 415, 4424, 464, 28713, 7062, 17909, 2264, 9430, 2903, 1200, 562, 6344, 6997, 3320, 684, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28783, 28782, 842, 8337, 614, 8337, 614, 6292, 506, 28636, 5915, 297, 272, 4205, 8207, 842, 415, 478, 2589, 288, 349, 459, 14598, 1200, 3545, 1200, 17692, 741, 5008, 582, 5705, 9842, 9784, 10858, 354, 2757, 1200, 562, 459, 264, 12711, 7650, 1200, 304, 8102, 5335, 2970, 12293, 18423, 842, 415, 15129, 453, 349, 459, 15045, 1200, 304, 18724, 1549, 6344, 11323, 1999, 6997, 3320, 684, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28783, 28782, 842, 415, 6139, 302, 26402, 477, 3999, 1432, 879, 298, 4117, 456, 879, 9768, 1002, 272, 16716, 302, 7474, 6292, 10389, 1200, 562, 4117, 403, 459, 396, 20202, 2102, 354, 1450, 5783, 11603, 404, 842, 3122, 24104, 304, 799, 2664, 11282, 28821, 434, 316, 2582, 26402, 4907, 28821, 28713, 738, 1162, 1938, 272, 2102, 1200, 562, 6292, 297, 799, 5020, 1200, 2490, 1611, 4076, 1200, 24642, 304, 8198, 288, 11282, 654, 10734, 288, 842, 12138, 10090, 3397, 369, 3999, 349, 2296, 272, 4117, 9156, 1200, 304, 1671, 26402, 272, 12820, 12095, 1835, 3999, 1432, 879, 622, 347, 1215, 1741, 442, 7087, 842, 13, 13, 7489, 8249, 6292, 325, 5353, 1059, 3999, 1143, 622, 948, 4337, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28750, 28752], 'total_duration': 2530159600, 'load_duration': 5105100, 'prompt_eval_count': 367, 'prompt_eval_duration': 987019000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1534930000}"
265,"January 30 , 1985 The expansion appears to have resumed in the First District . Retailers experienced reasonably satisfactory year-over-year increases in Christmas sales , although promotional activity reduced margins . Retail inventories are a little higher than desired . In the manufacturing sector , recent order experience varies considerably , with some firms reporting order increases , others flat order rates and a few decreases . However , all the manufacturers contacted have projected significant real gains in 1985 . Manufacturing inventories are in line with sales , based on past experience ; but several contacts are not satisfied with this performance and are pushing to lower inventory-to-sales ratios . There is no evidence of any pickup in inflation ; recent price increases have been very modest and price expectations for 1985 seem to have moderated . Mortgage rates have been gradually falling for several months . Retailing Stores in the First District reported respectable but not spectacular sales increases over the preceding year in December and early January . Promotional activity reduced margins and inventories are somewhat above plan . Most merchants expressed optimism about sales growth in 1985 . Sales increases among the retailers contacted ranged from 6 to 10 percent above December 1983 . The recent year-over-year increases are generally smaller than those recorded earlier in 1984 , but most stores expected this because 1983 finished so strongly .

Contacts with affiliates or branches in other parts of the country said New England stores showed the best performance .

266,"July bringing new orders for the first half above last year 's first half . Builders anticipate that the second half will be equally strong . However , there is little speculative building , as builders remain cautious and uncertain about how long the current uptrend will last . Real estate firms had an exceptional second quarter . The volume of contract closings at one realty firm was the highest in two years , and its forecast for closings in the second half has been revised upward , but the firm will remain in a wait-and-see posture until August before deciding whether to increase its staff . More move-up buyers are reentering housing markets . Mortgage lending volume is picking up with the 15-year mortgage becoming popular and the adjustable rate mortgage losing favor among borrowers . In the second half of the year , mortgage markets in Ohio will receive a boost from recently approved state-subsidized mortgage money that amounts to $ 346 million and that will be available to qualifying home buyers at 9.8 percent . Commercial Banking District loan demand continues to be mixed . Loans outstanding in all major categories at large banks increased over the past month .

Consumer Spending Large retailers or general merchandise in the Twin Cities report that business has been good . Two large district chain operations had better-than-expected performance in the first quarter , which appears to have continued into April . Major retailers in bustling Sioux Falls , South Dakota , report brisk business , attributed primarily to price reductions and aggressive advertising . But Bank directors note that business has slowed in southern Minnesota and has continued to lag throughout the agriculturally dependent parts of this district . A similar story is told for auto sales which have continued strong in diversified metro areas but have been generally weak in rural areas . Domestic manufacturers report that their sales , when compared to 1984 , increased 9 percent through April . Slack demand in nonmetro areas has bogged down truck sales somewhat , though . Housing activity is also still slack in rural areas , but sales of homes in the Twin Cities have improved . Sales in both Minneapolis and St. Paul have been well above 1984 levels -- by more than 12 percent this February , for example .

270,"Beige Book Report : Minneapolis May 6 , 1985 While overall employment and consumer spending have recently increased in the Ninth District , agricultural and resource-related weaknesses have continued . Some signs of slower manufacturing growth are also evident . Employment District labor market conditions have continued to improve , regularly in the service sectors . Spurred by larger-than-usual quarterly employment growth , the district 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell a few tenths to 6.3 percent in the first quarter . Indicative of this improvement , Minnesota 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent in March , its lowest since August 1981 . Also in March , nonfarm employment reached a record high in Minnesota . Employment growth has been particularly evident in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area , which at the end of last year ranked fifth fastest in employment growth among large metro areas . Strong labor demand is present in Minneapolis , where the help-wanted advertising index was recently 11 percent above its year-earlier level . The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate also appears to have fallen in Montana , dropping from 7.6 percent in January to a probable 7 percent in March . Recent labor developments have been mixed . Layoffs at a conglomerate with plants in the Twin Cities and Sioux Falls , South Dakota , continued . As a result , the latter area 's unemployment rate rose measurably .

271,"December 5 , 1985 Overview The economy appears to be growing slowly at best . Only Richmond describes its District economy as strong , although there is some optimism in the reports from Philadelphia and New York . Retail sales gains are uneven , and less-than-robust Christmas sales are expected . Auto sales are low now that special interest rate incentives have largely ended . Industrial activity continues quite sluggish with few gains yet from dollar depreciation . Residential construction is improving but non-residential construction is uneven . Agricultural prices remain weak despite some rises in meat prices ; agricultural land prices continue to fall and farm finances remain weak . Commercial bank consumer and real estate lending is rising further but business lending is declining in most Districts . Retail Sales October retail sales other than autos are mind , with most Districts reporting moderate year-over-year gains . Sales are frequently described as strong for apparel and weak for various hardgoods . Inventories are generally at desired levels and are being built cautiously as most retailers expect Christmas sales to show only moderate increases from 1984 .

Residential sales are strong in most areas , spurred by stable mortgage rates at just over 12 percent , rising incomes , and the availability of subsidized mortgage money in some states . House prices are reported to be firm and new listings strong . Nonresidential construction is generally weaker than residential building , but still healthy in many regions . There is some evidence that new construction may be slowing slightly , but projects already underway should provide continued strength . Many observers are surprised that nonresidential construction has not already lost steam , in view of rising vacancy rates and a general feeling that the office market is already overbuilt . Chicago notes that some projects have been started recently so that they will be grandfathered under the current tax code and thereby protected from future tax changes . Office leasing activity is mixed , with vacancy rates at suburban locations generally higher than in downtown areas . As a result , rents in suburban areas may hold steady or even fall in coming months . Agriculture While livestock farmers have gotten some measure of relief recently from higher livestock prices , crop farmers remain in financial stress in many areas , and may find their plight worsening . Harvests currently underway are likely to yield bumper crops that will drive farm prices and revenues even lower .

This is indicated in key words and phrases in district summaries : Boston , `` retail sales improving , manufacturing in the doldrums '' ; New York , `` little growth '' ; Philadelphia , `` same as August '' ; Cleveland , `` soft and uneven '' ; Richmond , no `` broadbased improvement '' ; Atlanta , `` healthy on balance '' ; Chicago , `` no overall pickup or weakening '' ; St. Louis , `` continues to lag '' ; Minneapolis , `` a bit weaker '' ; Kansas City and Dallas , `` sluggish '' ; and San Francisco , '' signals are mixed '' . Among economic sectors , however , there are significant variations . Perhaps the most troubled sector , at present , is agriculture , with prices and income severely depressed . Total employment is growing moderately , but with great variation by region . Manufacturing output , overall , is about stable . Mining , including oil and gas development , is depressed . Retail sales are somewhat stronger , but mainly disappointing . Auto sales have been stimulated by special financing . Inventories are in fairly good balance , and all types of goods readily available .

274,"December 5 , 1985 Overview Moat reports from around the Fifth District suggest that economic and business activity remains quite strong . Seasonal factors are causing some churning of employment activity , and special factors much as the end of the automobile financing opportunities of late summer and early fall are also causing some confusion . Nonetheless , employment , retail sales , construction , and housing sales are all reported , on balance , to be holding at quite high levels . Retail sales seem to be running well ahead of national trends , with experience varying significantly across product lines and regions . District employment has drawn recent support from construction , government , and to a lesser extent from manufacturing , sufficient to offset seasonal losses in agriculture related areas and tourism services . Manufacturing Manufacturing activity in the District , after leveling out in the past few months , is showing some signs of trying to bounce off of the bottom reached last summer . Several District states have experienced manufacturing employment gains lately , and even where employment shows continued weakness , average weekly hours of production workers has tuned up sharply . The modest gains achieved in the textile , apparel , and furniture industries a month ago are being held , and in some cases even built upon .

Some pickup in textile and apparel exports has developed of late providing some support for these industries , while in the furniture group , strong retail sales are beginning to",0.8,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:38:42.6213687Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.8}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 3337, 4354, 28705, 28782, 1200, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28783, 28782, 5235, 1578, 6885, 270, 7959, 477, 1401, 272, 23359, 8207, 3397, 369, 6638, 304, 1955, 6355, 7520, 3448, 2967, 842, 16887, 282, 8612, 460, 13098, 741, 484, 453, 288, 302, 14087, 6355, 1200, 304, 2841, 8612, 1188, 390, 272, 948, 302, 272, 4607, 4414, 27438, 8812, 302, 3909, 5561, 304, 2935, 2949, 460, 835, 13098, 741, 16630, 842, 9187, 19159, 1200, 14087, 1200, 11603, 6292, 1200, 6380, 1200, 304, 11821, 6292, 460, 544, 5745, 1200, 356, 7873, 1200, 298, 347, 6632, 438, 3448, 1486, 6157, 842, 8337, 614, 6292, 1709, 298, 347, 3822, 1162, 6280, 302, 4282, 17869, 1200, 395, 2659, 22312, 11117, 2673, 2093, 4715, 304, 10542, 842, 8207, 14087, 659, 10421, 5391, 1760, 477, 6380, 1200, 3058, 1200, 304, 298, 264, 26767, 11125, 477, 15186, 1200, 9406, 298, 4470, 3302, 282, 16275, 297, 24843, 5202, 5020, 304, 3884, 1443, 3345, 842, 19663, 1378, 19663, 1378, 6355, 297, 272, 8207, 1200, 1024, 2184, 288, 575, 297, 272, 2609, 1664, 3370, 1200, 349, 8102, 741, 10090, 302, 2942, 298, 287, 10818, 805, 302, 272, 5859, 5048, 1432, 5561, 842, 15223, 8207, 4605, 506, 8304, 15186, 14087, 21722, 22628, 1200, 304, 1019, 970, 14087, 4370, 5317, 18288, 1200, 5151, 16496, 3316, 302, 4885, 7433, 659, 15013, 286, 582, 26002, 842, 415, 23676, 21722, 12011, 297, 272, 2245, 546, 1200, 954, 24104, 1200, 304, 12389, 17909, 264, 2102, 3584, 460, 1250, 3336, 1200, 304, 297, 741, 4469, 1019, 4429, 3714, 842, 13, 13, 11600, 3088, 715, 297, 2245, 546, 304, 954, 24104, 10679, 659, 6202, 302, 3909, 7501, 741, 1760, 354, 1167, 17909, 1200, 1312, 297, 272, 12389, 2071, 1200, 2967, 11603, 6292, 460, 5398, 298, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28783, 28752], 'total_duration': 2594663100, 'load_duration': 6124000, 'prompt_eval_count': 349, 'prompt_eval_duration': 977252000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1609261000}"
275,"August 6 , 1985 Overview Business and economic conditions in the Fifth District continue to reflect somewhat disparate performance across sectors . On balance , activity seems flat to rising slightly . Some of the areas of earlier strength continue to lend support , while others , notably the retail sector , have softened markedly . Construction activity and house sales remain upbeat . Manufacturing is flat to down slightly , although there is some indication that the slide in manufacturing employment has been arrested . Coal production remains below year earlier , although stocks have been drawn down significantly since year-end . The service sector remains the primary source of employment growth . The outlook fur agriculture has improved somewhat of late because of much improved weather conditions . Manufacturing There is little evidence of any significant turnaround in the manufacturing sector despite a modestly improved employment situation . According to our reports , manufacturing shipments stabilized over the past month , although new orders and order backlogs both declined . Month to month changes continue to be dominated by such sectors as textiles , apparel , and furniture where imports continue to gain market share . Some of this weakness has been offset recently by very modest gains in primary and fabricated metals , food products , and segments of the chemicals industry .

Coal production continues to run slightly below year ago levels , but recent employment losses appear to have been stemmed in this industry as well .

However , pressure on costs is sufficiently severe that production increases do not result necessarily in more jobs . Mining sectors remain weak , with low prices and reduced employment in petroleum . With the exception of major gold mining and refining operations which have realized recent strength , there is no sign of improvement in the beleaguered mineral mining sector . Construction and Real Estate In general , building has been strong , although high vacancy rates in commercial and residential property in most parts of the district portend reduced construction activity in the future . While building permits remain strong in Phoenix , for example , many issued permits are not being used . Much of the residential building is focused on multifamily dwellings . In some markets , signals are mixed . For example , in Idaho , May residential permits were 28 percent below May 1984 , but the value of commercial construction was 45 percent above May 1984 .

One Arizona electronics manufacturer exports about 30 percent of its product to Japan . U.S. companies that have shifted manufacturing activities to Japan also expressed concern about the potential impact of more stringent tariffs . At the same time , some argue that the escalating trade friction has opened up Japanese markets to U.S. firms . In addition , both Taiwan and South Korea , fearing possible retaliatory actions against them , have taken significant steps to reduce tariffs and duties on a large number of items . Moreover , Japanese firms can be expected to continue shifting more production to the U.S. , with California a prime candidate for that investment . Finally , if allegations about semiconductor `` dumping '' are true , and if U.S. trade measures curtail dumping , western electronics firms should benefit . Agriculture and Resource Related Industries Prices for cattle and sheep have increased and reportedly are reaching profitable levels . However , ranchers remain cautious because higher prices tend to attract foreign imports in both markets . Prices of apples , potatoes and milk also have risen .

The cotton harvest began a month earlier than normal due to early planting . The only potential hazard remaining is overly wet harvest conditions . The combination of low- priced feed and favorable prices for hogs and cattle also has allowed livestock producers to enjoy a profitable year . Due to reduced acreage , large government payments to farmers , and lenders ' restraint , the volume of farm loans outstanding at District commercial banks in June fell by over 15 percent from last year .

Small-and medium-sized banks raised their mortgage rates following the May 11 prime rate increase . Consumer Spending Retail spending in the Second District continued somewhat sluggish in recent weeks with April sales ranging from below year-earlier levels to moderately above . The earlier Easter this year was noted as one factor in the slow April performance , but partial results for May were disappointing as well . As one retailer commented : '' Customers just are n't spending and we really do n't know why '' . Women 's apparel sales have remained weak and the gains which occurred in other lines were not particularly strong . Year-to-year changes at District stores in April ranged from -6.9 percent to +3.3 percent , results which were `` well below '' to `` just about on '' plan . Partial data for May show some over-the-year gains but smaller than were expected . Inventories were generally at comfortable levels , however , due to close monitoring and aggressive markdowns , though one respondent reported an undesired buildup . Business Activity Economic conditions in the Second District have been stable to moderately improved in recent weeks .

309,"September 20 , 1989 Summary Retailers appear more optimistic about sales prospects for the balance of this year , although sales patterns have been mixed . Manufacturing activity remains at high levels , but softening is apparent even in some capital goods industries . Steel operations have been reduced largely because of inventory liquidation . Commercial and industrial loans continue to soften . Money market rates are expected to ease over the next few months , and the thrift bailout has resulted in lower rates on CDs issued by thrifts . Retail Sales Department store retailers have become more optimistic about fall and holiday-season sales prospects apparently because of better- than-expected sales so far this summer . Apparel sales in particular revived from the slump in 1988 , and profits and profit margins improved last quarter without more than usual sales promotions . Retailers plan to hold larger inventories than they did late last year . A chain department store , however , believes that retailers are too optimistic and that inventories will become a growing problem over the next few months .

323,"but they anticipate some slackening in the expansion of commercial and industrial lending in the second half of the year . Manufacturing Activity in the Third District industrial sector appears to be easing to a steady pace . Just over half of the manufacturers contacted in late March and early April reported that business was stable , and the number noting improvement barely exceeded the number indicating that their business was slowing . Reports of improvement were common among nondurable goods producers while most makers of durables said business has been flat in recent weeks . Overall , executives at area industrial firms generally noted modest increases in new orders and a fractional rise in shipments but no change in order backlogs during March . On balance , area firms are permitting inventories to run down for the fourth month in a row . Employment is holding up as area manufacturing firms added marginally to payrolls during March . Industrial prices in the region continue to rise . Nearly half of the manufacturers contacted in April said input costs moved up from a month earlier and one-quarter raised the prices of the products they make .

324,"the survey participants responding in early March said their business was moving up from last month while 12 percent reported slower operations . Specific measures of industrial activity reflect this fractional growth . Area firms are booking more new orders than they did last month and they are stepping up shipments enough to work down order backlogs a bit . Inventories are level with last month . Employment shows only a little improvement as both payrolls and working hours are moving up just marginally . Survey respondents continue to report rising prices , although such indications do not appear to be as widespread this month as they have been for the past year . Nearly one-half of the firms polled for the March survey are paying higher prices for purchased goods compared to a month ago and one-quarter are charging more for their own products . Local manufacturers forecast only steady activity for the next six months , an improvement from the January and February surveys in which expectations of a downturn prevailed . The balance of responses to the most recent poll indicates that managers at area plants expect the rate of both new orders and shipments to be fairly flat for the next two quarters , and they anticipate a further decline in order backlogs . In accordance with these expectations , local firms ' employment plans call for steady payrolls and some shortening of the workweek between now and September .

Although slight gains were reported this summer , District residential construction growth remains sluggish . The value of District residential contracts issued in the first seven months of 1989 is virtually identical to that of a year earlier , with building of multi-family dwellings particularly weak . Agriculture Most District crops are in fair-to-good condition . Drier conditions in southern states have helped improve cotton and soybean crops that were damaged by excess rain earlier in the season . Continued rains in northern Missouri have helped drought-stressed late soybeans and pastures , but arrived too late to help the corn and sorghum crops . Agricultural banks servicing weather-stressed areas are not anticipating a substantial change in the quality of their agricultural loan portfolios this year . Banking District bank earnings declined 4.6 percent in the second quarter . Loan losses in the commercial area and additions to loan loss reserves hampered earnings . Asset quality declined during the second quarter , particularly at the largest banks where nonperforming loans represent 2.16 percent of total loans .

Recent behavior in retail sales and reports from retailers in several Districts indicate that sales have been slow in recent months , and are expected to remain so in the short term . It is unclear how much of the recent softness in retail sales represents temporary factors , such as unusual weather over the last several months . Both residential and nonresidential construction have been edging downward in recent months in most Districts , and indicators of future construction suggest further softening . Prospects for a good harvest this year should be improved as a result of ample rainfall in previously drought-stricken regions of the country , but cool , wet weather has delayed planting by as much as several weeks . The slow-growth economy is accompanied by an easing in demand for credit . Real estate loans , consumer loans , and business loans are still growing , but at reduced rates in recent months . Lenders are reported to have tightened standards especially for real estate loans , but there is still little information that suggests credit restraint is spreading into other markets .

Merchants contacted in early January said sales were running about even with or slightly above the year-ago pace . For the rest of the winter , most retailers expect sales to just match last year 's , in real terms . None of the store executives surveyed expressed strong optimism for the coming spring season . Several mentioned concern in the industry that major national retailers who are facing cash-flow difficulties might step up price discounting . After heavy discounting this Christmas , retailers are looking to reestablish stable pricing policies before the spring selling season begins . Finance Total loan volume at major Third District banks in late December was approximately 15 percent above the same period in the prior year , although growth appeared to ease during the month . Bankers contacted in early January said a slowdown in the rate of growth was continuing . Most expect overall loan demand to move up only modestly as the national economy enters at least one or two quarters of slower growth .

339,". Manufacturing Our regular mail survey suggested that District manufacturing activity declined slightly in early November . Respondents indicated that shipments , orders , and employment declined , but that inventories of raw materials and finished goods changed little . Most manufacturers felt that poor sales were their biggest problem , and manufacturers of furniture , textiles and apparel said their industries were definitely in recessions . Some manufacturers said that customers were increasingly reluctant to order very far ahead . Raw materials prices rose , but most manufacturers apparently held finished product prices steady . Even firms that use petroleum-based inputs like chemicals and plastics said that they had absorbed sharp increases in their raw material costs and had not increased prices of their finished goods . Manufacturers saw weakness in current economic conditions , but they were somewhat less pessimistic than a month ago about prospects for business next year . Most respondents believed that economic activity weakened in their local areas and in the nation in early November , and about half expected further weakening in the months ahead . A significantly larger number of respondents in November than in October , however , expected activity to pick up in coming months .

Port Activity Officials at District ports—Baltimore , Charleston , and Hampton Roads ( Norfolk ) —indicated that , seasonally adjusted , exports rose in October from September and imports were generally unchanged . Compared with a year ago , export activity was higher and import activity was mixed .

344,"for additional inventory accumulation . Financial Services According to most banking contacts , loan demand increased only slightly in the past month and remains below year-ago levels . They complain that it is difficult to obtain high quality loan applications . Much of the reported increase in demand was attributed to market share gains by the reporting banks as borrowers moved from troubled or merged institutions . On the other hand , one banker said that his institution may have tightened credit standards too much and was losing market share as a result . Auto dealers and construction contractors continue to report that credit is difficult to obtain . Construction Most realtor contacts had seen home sales levelling in their typical seasonal pattern in October and early November . Homes in the lower price range continued to report the most sales activity as lower mortgage interest rates stimulated first-time home buyers . Sales of higher priced homes remained sluggish , forcing sellers to reduce prices . Some contacts noted a strengthening in multifamily leasing and rental rates ; however , they saw little new construction of multifamily residences . Meanwhile , several contacts report small gains in the activity of surviving home builders in the past several months .

347,"October 23 , 1991 Summary Underlying trends in the District economy have changed little over the past month , according to most contacts , although continued sluggishness in consumer demand has led to some slowing in the pace of recovery in industrial activity . Manufacturers generally continued to provide an important contribution to District growth , but several contacts stated that auto production gains could slow in the fourth quarter if car sales growth does not improve . District commercial and industrial loan demand remained soft , in part due to moderate requirements for inventory financing . The agricultural harvest is proceeding rapidly , and harvest estimates have been raised recently . Consumer Spending District contacts indicate that consumer spending gains remained sluggish in September and early October , with dollar sales depressed by intense price competition . A large general merchandise chain reported continued flat sales and stated that there was little sign of a recovery in consumer spending . A retailers ' association in Indiana stated that its membership 's sales growth generally remains flat , while losses from bad checks have not improved significantly .

369,"declines in asking rental rates have so increased leasing activity that the inventory of available space has finally begun to decline . Consumer Spending Second District department stores reported that sales growth was slightly stronger in April than in May . Although the range of year- to-year sales growth was quite similar for both months -- flat to +15 percent in April as compared to -3 percent to +15 percent in May -- more stores were clustered near the bottom of the range during the most recent period . Easter boosted sales of children 's clothing in April , while unusually cool weather slowed apparel sales the following month . All contacts reported inventories on plan . Fifteen New York metropolitan area department stores are scheduled to close by summer 's end , resulting in the loss of 7,200 jobs . Several of the stores are the last remaining retail anchors in older downtown areas ; the Fordham Road section of the Bronx and downtown Newark and New Rochelle are expected to be particularly hard hit . On a more positive note , a major New Jersey shopping mall has announced plans for expansion and renovation , including three new luxury department stores to replace two anchors which had previously closed .

Manufacturers noted increases in shipments and new orders although they continue to report declines in employment . Retailers generally indicated that both customer traffic and sales remained on an upward trend , and most of those contacted in late November said business was running at or above the pace they had expected for the month . Third District bankers noted an increase in demand for commercial and industrial loans . They said they continued to originate a large number of residential mortgages but applications for both refinancing and purchase mortgages had dropped sharply in recent weeks . Looking ahead , most of the Third District business contacts polled for this report anticipate continuing improvement at a modest pace . Manufacturers generally expect the upward trend in orders to remain intact , boosting order backlogs and prompting some increases in employment during the next six months . On the basis of the current pace of sales , retailers have raised their expectations for the Christmas season . Many believe that sales for this holiday period will exceed last year 's by a better margin than has been the case in recent years .

In Alabama , Tennessee , and Florida , crop yields are expected to be reduced by 5 to 20 percent as a result of the drought , although total losses in these states are not expected to approach those in Georgia . While Mississippi and Louisiana enjoyed excellent weather until late in the growing season , a lack of rain in late August and September has reduced yields on most major crops , including cotton and soybeans . Wages and Prices There were no reports of increased wage pressures in September and early October . Construction companies and furniture manufacturers , however , noted that lumber prices have been edging higher since early August .",0.2,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:43:00.952429Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.2}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 644, 346, 4527, 842, 5800, 18350, 18222, 305, 2570, 659, 7568, 2967, 438, 1080, 13283, 1200, 1792, 262, 834, 742, 5317, 298, 1038, 582, 684, 1712, 28733, 14446, 302, 544, 18222, 15556, 842, 5504, 3972, 305, 2570, 354, 4607, 4414, 25596, 659, 28636, 1854, 272, 5561, 1200, 304, 7380, 9976, 5637, 659, 7568, 4548, 286, 5473, 272, 8207, 842, 23837, 482, 1298, 2729, 14075, 369, 13645, 281, 3928, 4331, 3708, 392, 297, 5971, 304, 6287, 13188, 842, 6586, 298, 1868, 16438, 1200, 3102, 22815, 16275, 297, 13188, 460, 3349, 298, 1147, 4119, 429, 28705, 28782, 28734, 28734, 3841, 842, 560, 20339, 1200, 19793, 1200, 304, 9500, 1200, 21948, 18934, 460, 3349, 298, 347, 9397, 486, 28705, 28782, 298, 28705, 28750, 28734, 4153, 390, 264, 1204, 302, 272, 281, 3928, 1200, 5432, 3102, 16275, 297, 1167, 4605, 460, 459, 3349, 298, 4431, 1395, 297, 13188, 842, 4023, 20455, 304, 24269, 10306, 8099, 8086, 1996, 3909, 297, 272, 6485, 3302, 1200, 264, 5502, 302, 7296, 297, 3909, 3628, 304, 4074, 659, 9397, 18934, 356, 1080, 3014, 27152, 1200, 2490, 18633, 304, 579, 28724, 22672, 842, 394, 1291, 304, 1921, 1214, 1387, 654, 708, 7959, 302, 7483, 21062, 2944, 1238, 297, 4074, 304, 2935, 4527, 842, 22061, 4799, 304, 12389, 19245, 1200, 3545, 1200, 8659, 369, 305, 1031, 8506, 506, 750, 1382, 3080, 4337, 1854, 2935, 3628, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28750, 28752], 'total_duration': 2488386800, 'load_duration': 7537700, 'prompt_eval_count': 290, 'prompt_eval_duration': 837368000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1640686000}"

380,"June 23 , 1993 Summary Economic expansion in the District continued in May and early June . Reports from retailers and consumer goods manufacturers suggest that retail sales growth picked up modestly , aided in part by pent-up demand after unseasonably bad weather in the first quarter . Manufacturing activity continued its expansion , with slowing growth in some sectors offset by improving results in several industries that had previously been weak . Motor vehicle production continued to gain momentum , with output plans for the third quarter calling for a significant increase over year-earlier levels . Survey-based measures and reports from individual businesses gave no evidence of significant upward pressure on prices . Retail Sales Reports from large retailers and manufacturers of consumer goods suggest that consumer demand increased in the District in recent months . A large department store chain reported that sales growth in the Midwest increased moderately ( on a seasonally adjusted basis ) in May and early June , after a snapback in April from weather-depressed levels in the first quarter . Sales strength remained concentrated in durable goods , notably appliances and home improvement items . Credit utilization continued to rise and delinquency rates continued to improve .

A manufacturer of heavy equipment experiencing renewed strength in most of its business lines cited the lack of a generalized upturn in demand for commodities as the most important factor leading sales of mining equipment to lag the companywide average . One manufacturer in an international market stated `` many of the price increases we do see are coming from the import side . '' Agriculture The pace in crop plantings improved considerably in recent weeks , overcoming most of the earlier delays from cool , wet weather . The delays may result in some modest shifting in the mix of crop acres . However , analysts believe that virtually all of the intended corn acreage in District states was seeded prior to the passing of critical planting dates . ( June 15 is generally regarded as the latest acceptable date for planting corn . ) Early crop development -- both for field crops and for much of the District 's vegetable acreage -- is below normal due to the late plantings . However , moisture supplies in most areas are adequate to abundant and the return of warmer weather brings hopes for faster crop development .",0.5,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:43:14.5171586Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.5}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 27609, 835, 16085, 486, 13551, 12711, 28713, 842, 330, 17746, 302, 5917, 7108, 20998, 13293, 286, 6342, 297, 1080, 302, 871, 1955, 4715, 22881, 272, 5502, 302, 264, 2952, 1332, 332, 447, 453, 297, 5637, 354, 25794, 1218, 390, 272, 1080, 2278, 6999, 5374, 6292, 302, 15121, 7108, 298, 16369, 272, 2496, 5734, 5151, 842, 2387, 17746, 297, 396, 5611, 2668, 9256, 5008, 1287, 302, 272, 4144, 12095, 478, 511, 1032, 460, 3524, 477, 272, 726, 2081, 842, 9842, 23837, 482, 415, 13681, 297, 21948, 5100, 742, 11957, 25013, 297, 5391, 4587, 1200, 754, 4343, 1080, 302, 272, 5585, 882, 748, 477, 5106, 1200, 7569, 8086, 842, 415, 882, 748, 993, 1204, 297, 741, 23676, 24334, 297, 272, 6750, 302, 21948, 20647, 842, 2993, 1200, 22275, 28713, 3091, 369, 17626, 544, 302, 272, 8926, 16869, 264, 961, 465, 297, 8207, 4605, 403, 11057, 286, 4681, 298, 272, 9720, 302, 7276, 5100, 288, 12791, 842, 325, 4212, 28705, 28740, 28782, 349, 6741, 15390, 390, 272, 7345, 18636, 3608, 354, 5100, 288, 16869, 842, 1143, 12138, 21948, 4099, 1939, 1560, 354, 1834, 27152, 304, 354, 1188, 302, 272, 8207, 464, 28713, 10035, 522, 264, 961, 465, 1939, 349, 3624, 4123, 2940, 298, 272, 3909, 5100, 742, 842, 2993, 1200, 28224, 13679, 297, 1080, 5020, 460, 23193, 298, 15116, 440, 304, 272, 604, 302, 1496, 794, 8086, 11164, 15721, 354, 9556, 21948, 4099, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28782, 28752], 'total_duration': 2456849400, 'load_duration': 7698800, 'prompt_eval_count': 296, 'prompt_eval_duration': 836854000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1610458000}"
382,"March 10 , 1993 Summary District business activity continues to improve . Consumer spending is stronger than retailers expected after the December buying spree , with spring apparel and household durables selling particularly well . Orders and production schedules for many manufacturers , including steel , autos , and capital goods , are higher this quarter than last . Increased production and orders have led some companies to rehire workers , but employment gains still lag far behind output growth . Lenders report an increase in credit-card use and mortgage refinancing , but little growth in business loans . Consumer Spending District retail sales continue to be stronger than retailers expected , with sales reported to be 5 % to 10 % higher than last year at this time . The post-holiday performance has been particularly impressive because the companies interviewed have not been discounting prices heavily , as inventories of leftover winter goods are low and early orders for spring merchandise were conservative . Demand for spring fashions is significant , and consumers appear particularly interested in new design items as opposed to basic apparel . Retailers see this trend as indicating that consumers are moving beyond basic needs to more discretionary items . Durable goods , including high-end entertainment electronics , have also been moving well .

Pittsburgh area retailers point to an improving new home market as a major source of increasing demand for household durables , such as furniture and appliances . Motor vehicle sales continue to improve , with truck sales",0.9,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:43:17.1217052Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.9}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 28755, 1161, 28705, 28740, 28734, 1200, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28774, 28770, 23276, 8207, 1955, 6355, 10352, 298, 4916, 842, 5504, 3972, 9981, 349, 12774, 821, 11603, 404, 3349, 1024, 272, 4925, 9737, 668, 688, 1200, 395, 7474, 954, 24104, 304, 13634, 5598, 2561, 10158, 6311, 1162, 842, 1667, 10802, 304, 4885, 22245, 2464, 354, 1287, 19245, 1200, 2490, 9445, 1200, 1206, 385, 1200, 304, 5565, 11282, 1200, 460, 4337, 456, 8249, 821, 1432, 842, 24377, 1293, 4885, 304, 8636, 506, 4163, 741, 4799, 298, 312, 20685, 7433, 1200, 562, 14087, 21722, 1309, 16369, 2082, 2910, 3825, 6057, 842, 393, 14930, 2264, 396, 5247, 297, 6183, 28733, 5538, 938, 304, 18222, 1792, 262, 7161, 1200, 562, 1628, 6057, 297, 1955, 15556, 842, 5504, 3972, 1670, 2570, 8207, 11603, 6292, 3688, 298, 347, 12774, 821, 11603, 404, 3349, 1200, 395, 6292, 5745, 298, 347, 28705, 28782, 1239, 298, 28705, 28740, 28734, 1239, 4337, 821, 1432, 879, 438, 456, 727, 842, 415, 1704, 28733, 5236, 5036, 4397, 659, 750, 6311, 14714, 1096, 272, 4799, 28178, 506, 459, 750, 12711, 288, 8506, 12759, 1200, 390, 9182, 2420, 302, 462, 28722, 532, 343, 8539, 11282, 460, 2859, 304, 2935, 8636, 354, 7474, 18724, 391, 864, 654, 16038, 842, 4267, 391, 354, 7474, 285, 1029, 594, 349, 5864, 1200, 304, 13776, 4305, 6311, 6348, 297, 633, 2621, 4907, 390, 13970, 298, 6471, 954, 24104, 842, 8337, 614, 404, 1032, 456, 9156, 390, 17888, 369, 13776, 460, 5272, 5298, 6471, 3208, 298, 680, 22683, 296, 628, 4907, 842, 8420, 522, 11282, 1200, 2490, 1486, 28733, 416, 15175, 14044, 1063, 1200, 506, 835, 750, 5272, 1162, 842, 13, 13, 28753, 785, 23679, 2698, 11603, 404, 1305, 298, 396, 16752, 633, 1611, 2668, 390, 264, 3014, 2832, 302, 6488, 5637, 354, 13634, 5598, 2561, 1200, 1259, 390, 12389, 304, 14933, 20904, 842, 17933, 8114, 6292, 3688, 298, 4916, 1200, 395, 8388, 6292, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28774, 28752], 'total_duration': 2600133800, 'load_duration': 6485700, 'prompt_eval_count': 378, 'prompt_eval_duration': 982365000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1609628000}"

Office leasing activity picked up in recent weeks , however , and primary vacancy rates declined in much of the District . New Jersey 's unemployment rate fell sharply in May while New York 's rate rose .

397,"March 9 , 1994 Manufacturing continues its gradual recovery in the First District , but severe winter weather has temporarily set back area retailers . Contacts in both sectors see little price pressure and anticipate moderate growth for the remainder of the year . Commercial real estate continues steady , while investment management firms report strong growth . Retail Winter storms and cold temperatures took a considerable bite out of retail sales in the First District . Sales in January and early February were either flat or down , in some cases as much as 15 percent , compared to year-earlier levels . Apparel stores were particularly hard hit ; fewer shoppers took advantage of January promotions , leaving retailers with excess inventories of seasonal clothing . Contacts reported no significant rebound in sales after storms . The fortunate retailers were those with stocks of winter survival items , such as salt , dry gas , shovels , and cold medicine . Despite the short-term setback , retailers seem more optimistic about this year than last , anticipating 2 to 10 percent growth in sales . Many expect to see gross margins and profits increase as a result of fewer markdowns , better management of inventories , and continued cost controls .

Aside from the weather effects , the underlying upward momentum in consumption and housing activity may have slowed somewhat from the unusually rapid fourth quarter pace . Reports from manufacturers generally remained quite upbeat , although a number of manufacturing contacts expressed greater uncertainty about the pace of activity in their markets in the latter half of 1994 , citing the effects of increases in interest rates . Reports of price increases remained concentrated in building materials and metals industries . Early planting and weaker export prospects are currently weighing on crop prices , but District farmland values continued to appreciate in early 1994 . Retail Sales and Housing Consumer spending and housing activity continued to expand in the District in recent months , aided by substantial improvement in the weather following unusually harsh conditions earlier in the year . A large general merchandise retailer stated that underlying sales momentum remained positive through early April , with sales of home furnishings and other housing-related items still leading overall sales growth . This firm 's outstanding consumer loans are sill rising , while delinquency rates continue to decline .

Another large national retailer reported that its sales growth slowed in April on a holiday-adjusted basis .

A survey of a large number of smaller retailers in Illinois and Indiana continued to show an improving trend in recent months . Home sales and construction activity surged in the region as 1993 came to a close , with little sign of a slowdown in the underlying momentum thus far in 1994 . Some realty and banking contacts attributed at least part of the increased activity to home buyers ' beliefs that mortgage interest rates may have stopped declining , leading sonic to conclude that the recent burst in activity could prove short-lived . Still , reports from local realtor boards in the region remained quite optimistic , with most noting that sales closings rose faster in January and February than in late 1993 . At the same time , the bad weather postponed home showings , which could be followed by slower growth in closings in March and April . One of the largest realtors in the District reported that transactions in January rose over 30 percent from year-earlier levels , partly due to special factors , but results were still a good deal better than expected .

However , all of the respondents did speak of increasingly competitive market conditions and thinning profit margins . Housing and Construction The extremely strong performance of the housing sector in the last part of 1993 is not seen as sustainable . There is a sense that some of last year 's activity was driven by a belief that interest rates had reached their trough , triggering some amount of speculative buying . Nonetheless , 1994 is expected to be solid , reflecting strong underlying demand due to demographic factors , moderating long-term interest rates , and slight increases in income and employment . Housing markets in the Fourth District have been strong for some time , and more of the same is expected for 1994 . Lending Activity Consumers are said to `` look healthy '' : Delinquency rates are low and indexes of borrowing by existing customers are their strongest in more than two years . Commercial loans , which were down at the end of 1993 , picked up somewhat at the beginning of the year . The rise in interest rates has cooled mortgage refinancings , and slower growth in consumer loans is expected to ensue as a result of mortgage borrowing having reached its peak . However , considerable strength is seen as a result of auto demand , including commercial borrowing for dealer floor plans .",0.6,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:44:02.1870992Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.6}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 21650, 4084, 304, 5353, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28774, 28770, 1200, 562, 11603, 404, 4305, 6997, 3320, 684, 5391, 6292, 21722, 304, 652, 22570, 354, 3774, 28733, 6590, 12077, 5637, 842, 2993, 1200, 544, 302, 272, 9421, 788, 863, 4085, 302, 13107, 13473, 2668, 4331, 304, 9026, 971, 11876, 15003, 1126, 842, 382, 23291, 304, 22061, 415, 7625, 2967, 4397, 302, 272, 11821, 9642, 297, 272, 1432, 744, 302, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28774, 28770, 349, 459, 2598, 390, 19318, 842, 1387, 349, 264, 3367, 369, 741, 302, 1432, 879, 464, 28713, 6355, 403, 12215, 486, 264, 12519, 369, 2145, 7978, 553, 5048, 652, 467, 900, 1200, 8366, 288, 741, 3558, 302, 1229, 20851, 9737, 842, 9187, 19159, 1200, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28774, 28781, 349, 3349, 298, 347, 6861, 1200, 7967, 288, 2967, 14164, 5637, 2940, 298, 1493, 12293, 8612, 1200, 11323, 1077, 1043, 28733, 6590, 2145, 7978, 1200, 304, 5543, 12095, 297, 7904, 304, 14087, 842, 382, 23291, 11574, 297, 272, 28185, 8207, 506, 750, 2967, 354, 741, 727, 1200, 304, 680, 302, 272, 1348, 349, 3349, 354, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28774, 28781, 842, 393, 2570, 24066, 5504, 383, 404, 460, 773, 298, 5008, 913, 7783, 9842, 714, 5526, 262, 364, 2090, 7978, 460, 2859, 304, 2991, 274, 302, 14219, 288, 486, 6594, 5688, 460, 652, 27686, 297, 680, 821, 989, 1267, 842, 24551, 15556, 1200, 690, 654, 1060, 438, 272, 948, 302, 28705, 28740, 28774, 28774, 28770, 1200, 7715, 582, 10963, 438, 272, 5398, 302, 272, 879, 842, 415, 8418, 297, 2145, 7978, 659, 5106, 286, 18222, 1792, 262, 834, 742, 1200, 304, 25642, 6057, 297, 12077, 15556, 349, 3349, 298, 3956, 441, 390, 264, 1204, 302, 18222, 14219, 288, 2461, 5048, 871, 13093, 842, 2993, 1200, 16062, 6342, 349, 2598, 390, 264, 1204, 302, 4027, 5637, 1200, 2490, 7380, 14219, 288, 354, 25863, 4366, 6400, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28784, 28752], 'total_duration': 2627187100, 'load_duration': 7739800, 'prompt_eval_count': 372, 'prompt_eval_duration': 997694000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1619907000}"

But most manufacturers also note selected areas of market weakness , and the region 's retailers report disappointing results . While commodity prices continue to rise , some contacts report signs of deceleration ; sales prices remain stable at most firms . Retail First District retail contacts were disappointed with January and February sales , which mostly ranged from level to 10 percent below year-ago levels . Retailers indicated , however , that year-over-year comparisons were misleading because last year saw sales fluctuations caused by winter storms while this year 's weather is unseasonably warm . Poor sellers were apparel , particularly winter clothing , snow- removal equipment , housewares , sports equipment , and ready-to- assemble furniture . Home office and electronics continued to perform well . Reports on price increases varied considerably . A few retailers cited an overall rise of 2 to 3 percent in vendor prices , and increases of over 10 percent on leather , plastic , and paper products .

Retail sales improved and manufacturers continued to operate at high levels of capacity . While single-family homebuilding slowed further , multifamily construction picked up in some parts of the district The district 's winter wheat crop was generally in good condition , and recent gains in crop and livestock prices have brightened the outlook for district farm incomes . While materials prices for manufacturers continued to rise throughout the region , upward pressure on wages was less prevalent . Retailers held prices steady despite increases in costs of goods and labor . Retail Sales Retailers report that sales improved over the past month and were ahead of year-ago sales . Much of the improvement , however , can be attributed to recent clearance promotions . Unseasonably warm weather continued to hamper sales of outerwear and other seasonal merchandise .

Most auto dealers report slightly declining sales over the past month , due primarily to higher financing costs for consumers . Nevertheless , auto dealers expect sales to pick up in the spring . Manufacturing Most firms continued to operate at high levels of capacity last month . Manufacturing lead times increased but are expected to shorten in the months ahead .

433,"March 13 , 1996 Overview The Tenth District economy continued to grow at a moderate pace during the past month . Retail sales increased modestly and homebuilding activity strengthened . Manufacturing activity slowed slightly . Energy activity remained sluggish , while weak profits in the cattle industry held down farm income . Labor markets remained tight in much of the district , but wages generally held steady and retail prices rose only slightly . Retail Sales Retailers report sales increased modestly over the past month and remained above last year 's level . Some retailers report sales of apparel were strong , while sales of home furnishings were weak . Retailers generally expect sales to strengthen during the next few months . Most retailers indicate satisfaction with their inventory levels and expect to hold inventories steady in the months ahead . Automobile dealers report sales increased slightly last month from the sluggish pace the month before , and most dealers are optimistic that sales will strengthen further this spring . Manufacturing District manufacturers continued to operate at high levels of capacity last month , although there were some signs of slowing in manufacturing activity . No production bottlenecks due to capacity constraints were reported .

Manufacturing Manufacturing activity in the Third District maintained a level pace in February according to reports from industrial firms , although slightly more firms said they were experiencing a pickup than said business was off . Firms in most of the major manufacturing sectors in the District indicated that demand for their products was just steady . However , some gains in orders were noted by firms producing metal products , nonelectrical machinery , chemicals , paper products , and textiles . Overall , however , demand for manufactured products did not appear to be strengthening for firms in the region ; on balance , they reported that order backlogs continued on the downward trend that began late last year . A dip in employment and a decline in industrial prices that manufacturers noted in February are further evidence of slack in the goods-producing sector of the District . Looking ahead , most of the Third District manufacturers contacted in February expect demand for their products to pick up by summer . On balance , they foresee a rising pace of orders and shipments , but they do not expect order backlogs to move up strongly . Likewise , they anticipate only very slight increases in employment .

Permits to build New York City apartments , which rose sharply in 1996 , remained high in January , suggesting brisk construction activity in 1997 .

The major concern of employers , however , continued to be labor shortages . Though these shortages were broad-based , information technology and construction workers were most often cited as being in short supply and accounting professionals were again hard to find heading into the upcoming tax season . A major producer of high-tech equipment reported that some projects had to be scuttled because of the shortage of engineers . Homebuilders ' associations in Wisconsin recently began setting up recruiting booths at some of the state 's `` home shows . '' The shortages continued to hinder the District 's employment growth and most analysts contacted expect this to continue into 1998 .

Manufacturing materials were generally available , with only spotty evidence of marginal increases in lead times . Inventories last month were flat , and managers reported mixed feelings about their satisfaction with current stock levels . However , manufacturers plan to trim inventories somewhat in the near future . Housing Strong momentum continued in construction activity with builders reporting that housing starts remained relatively high last month , and well above year-ago levels . Builders expect a seasonal flattening in construction activity in the coming months . While sales of new homes were up again , they grew at a slower pace than in the recent past . The consistently strong sales have left inventories of unsold new homes at low levels . Mortgage lenders reported that demand last month was generally unchanged , but remained well above year-ago levels . Home purchases continued to account for close to half of mortgage activity . Although less optimistic than in our previous survey , lenders expect mortgage demand to stay modestly strong over the next three months as rates remain low . Banking Bankers reported that loans and deposits both edged up last month , leaving loan-deposit ratios little changed .

Consumer loans , home mortgage loans , and agricultural loans increased , while other loan categories were generally unchanged . Increases in money market deposit accounts and large CDs accounted for the rise in deposits .",0.8,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:46:52.3569262Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.8}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 28723, 19663, 1378, 320, 8016, 8207, 15186, 6355, 7568, 11735, 2967, 1432, 2102, 395, 9923, 10513, 438, 1486, 6157, 302, 8444, 842, 19663, 1378, 7069, 654, 6741, 2632, 1200, 395, 865, 6297, 884, 5566, 302, 25286, 12095, 297, 1736, 2421, 842, 560, 1071, 2420, 1432, 2102, 654, 7007, 1200, 304, 17490, 5745, 9430, 9388, 684, 652, 16456, 395, 1868, 5756, 6157, 842, 2993, 1200, 19245, 2623, 298, 13893, 9182, 2420, 10963, 297, 272, 3065, 3437, 842, 382, 23291, 23516, 14019, 5317, 297, 6380, 6355, 395, 1813, 404, 14438, 369, 11821, 8383, 7568, 10102, 1486, 1432, 2102, 1200, 304, 1162, 2747, 879, 28733, 4567, 6157, 842, 8245, 404, 1675, 264, 3302, 282, 972, 1061, 3250, 297, 6380, 6355, 297, 272, 3524, 3370, 842, 4023, 6292, 302, 633, 9039, 654, 582, 1076, 1200, 590, 8108, 438, 264, 25642, 13681, 821, 297, 272, 5391, 2609, 842, 415, 18667, 2967, 6292, 506, 1749, 9182, 2420, 302, 10214, 738, 633, 9039, 438, 2859, 6157, 842, 14789, 11332, 305, 14930, 5745, 369, 5637, 1432, 2102, 403, 6741, 521, 11247, 1200, 562, 7568, 1162, 2747, 879, 28733, 4567, 6157, 842, 6434, 25596, 5317, 298, 2708, 354, 2848, 298, 2795, 302, 18222, 6355, 842, 5800, 2108, 6997, 3320, 821, 297, 813, 3454, 10911, 1200, 305, 14930, 1675, 18222, 5637, 298, 3079, 968, 19067, 2967, 754, 272, 1679, 1712, 3370, 390, 7978, 6344, 2859, 842, 7838, 288, 7838, 404, 5745, 369, 15556, 304, 11199, 1046, 1560, 1382, 2560, 582, 1432, 2102, 1200, 6285, 9976, 28733, 450, 1065, 279, 6172, 2806, 1628, 4648, 842, 13, 13, 23123, 15556, 1200, 1611, 18222, 15556, 1200, 304, 22815, 15556, 7483, 1200, 1312, 799, 9976, 13187, 654, 6741, 521, 11247, 842, 24377, 2018, 297, 2445, 2668, 17435, 9855, 304, 2475, 8204, 28713, 2708, 286, 354, 272, 8418, 297, 11199, 1046, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28783, 28752], 'total_duration': 2722421000, 'load_duration': 7332900, 'prompt_eval_count': 362, 'prompt_eval_duration': 979726000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1733755000}"

New trucks and SUVs remained the hottest sellers , however , and most dealers complained of shortages of these vehicles . Like most other retailers , auto dealers remain very optimistic about sales in the near future . Manufacturing Tenth District manufacturing activity held steady last month , albeit at a relatively weak level . Plants were operating at similar capacities - medium to high - as in our previous survey , but still well below levels posted a year ago . Manufacturing materials were generally available with lead times practically unchanged , and managers had little concern about availability in the near future . Factories began modestly increasing inventories in March and early April , and managers were happier with current stock levels than in the recent past . The increases were small , however , and most survey contacts anticipate having to trim inventories in coming months as stiff competition from low-price imports continues . Housing Construction activity remained strong last month , although housing starts in some parts of the district were slightly below last year 's pace . Nearly all builders expect even better performance in the months ahead .

New York purchasing managers report that manufacturing activity expanded at a brisk pace in both June and July , following a dip in May . Buffalo-area purchasers report that production activity grew at about the same modest pace in July as in the second quarter , while new orders and employment levels were little changed . Surveys in both these areas indicate a noticeable pickup in prices for manufacturing inputs . There have been reports of significant shipping delays due to the merger of Conrail into CSX and Norfolk Southern , though contacts do not see any problems comparable to last year 's merger between Union Pacific and Southern Pacific . One contact at a short-line railroad in upstate New York says that , while delays persisted in July , they were not as bad as in June ; conditions are expected to be back to normal by around the end of October . Some shipping has been diverted to trucks , but not much . Hotel occupancy rates in New York City held steady throughout the second quarter at just above 80 percent -- a high level but about 5 points lower than a year earlier .

While there are scattered reports of upward price pressures , they appear to remain relatively subdued . Most retailers report that sales were above plan in May , despite unseasonably cool weather which held down sales of summer merchandise . Residential real estate markets remain strong , though activity appears to have leveled off in the second quarter , largely due to supply constraints . Regional purchasing managers report a slowdown in manufacturing activity in May , along with some upturn in input prices . The breakup of Conrail and its recent merger into CSX and Norfolk Southern appears to have caused only minor operational glitches thus far . Local banks report a dip in demand for residential mortgages and consumer loans , and continued improvement in delinquency rates . Consumer Spending Retailers report that sales were on or above plan in May , and would have been stronger still , except that unseasonably cool weather held down sales of summer merchandise . Overall , same-store sales for May were up by roughly 4 percent on average , though individual gains ranged from 2 to 8 percent .

Buyer traffic has been down recently in many parts of the District , while inventories have risen somewhat and the use of price concessions has increased . Both builders and realtors noted that home sales had weakened in early October . Contacts anticipate continued moderate slowing in the housing sector through the remainder of the year .

Manufacturing Contacts paint a mixed picture of recent factory activity . Military contracts and high-tech industries are continuing to stimulate manufacturing activity in the District .

A few contacts at tech consulting firms reported that more workers were `` sitting on the bench '' as many projects had been cancelled .

504,"January 19 , 2000 Reports from most Federal Reserve Districts indicated strong economic growth in December and early January . Economic activity was described as strong in most Federal Reserve Districts . Growth was characterized as solid in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts , and as moderate in the Districts of Atlanta and Chicago . Consumer spending growth was rapid during the holiday shopping period , and many retailers expect the high level of activity to continue into early 2000 . Manufacturing continued to expand in nearly every District and was broadly based across industries . Exceptions to this were in the food , apparel , agricultural equipment , and some construction-based industries . Residential real estate construction was mixed across regions , with the northeastern states experiencing an inventory shortage , the southern and midwestern states a slowdown , and the western states an expansion . Commercial construction activity varied across the country . Bank lending was mixed , with a decrease in mortgage lending that was often offset by increases in consumer and commercial lending . Labor markets remained tight in all Districts . However , the tight labor markets did not seem to be matched with large wage increases .

In contrast , purchase money mortgage lending has been rising , on balance , at banks in the region . Commercial bank lending officers anticipate that growth in business lending might ease as both lenders and borrowers become more cautious about leverage ratios and debt service burdens . However , bankers do not see any indications at this time of a slowdown in business activity in the region .

However , labor markets have remained fairly buoyant , although less so than they had been earlier in the year . Industrial Activity The steel industry is facing some tough times . Mills are operating 10 to 30 percent below capacity , domestic demand has slowed , and there is intense competition from foreign producers , in part due to the strong dollar .

Producers of specialty steel are in a better position . While prices on specialty steel products decreased along with carbon steel , orders for specialty steel remain stronger . Consumer Spending Retail stores reported disappointing sales during the entire holiday season , with the lackluster performance extending across all categories .

516,"November 28 , 2001 Reports from the Federal Reserve districts indicate that economic activity generally remained soft in October and the first half of November , with evidence of additional slowing in most regions outweighing signs of recovery in a few districts . Manufacturing activity weakened further , with declines in production , new orders and employment widely reported . Consumer spending was mixed—aggressive financing incentives drove automobile and light truck sales to exceptional levels , but tourism remained weak and nonauto sales were spotty , with stronger sales growth in some areas offset by weaker sales elsewhere . Retailers ' outlook for spending during the upcoming holiday season was also mixed . Store managers had already begun discounting prices in some areas to counteract weak customer traffic , while in other areas retailers ' expectations for the season had brightened recently . Residential real estate generally held its own , with sales of moderately-priced homes steady and permits for new construction increasing modestly in all but a few regions . In contrast , the demand for commercial space eased further , pushing vacancy rates higher and rents lower in many areas . In the finance sector , the pace of residential mortgage refinancing activity accelerated as mortgage interest rates fell further .

Despite recent easing in oil prices , contacts in the Dallas , Kansas City , and Minneapolis districts reported that oil and natural gas prices remain sufficiently high to promote continued expansion of exploration and production . However , Dallas and Kansas City reported that the pace of industry expansion is constrained by worker and equipment shortages . Given these shortages , the recent dramatic rise in natural gas prices is not expected to produce a further acceleration in drilling activity . Other extraction industries are not doing as well , as metal mining and processing activity in the Minneapolis district continued to decline in the face of falling commodity prices and high electricity costs . In the farm economy , the onset of winter weather across the country has had mixed effects . Minneapolis reported that moisture from heavy snowfalls has benefited the winter wheat crop and is expected to reduce the likelihood of drought conditions in the coming growing season . However , severe winter weather also contributed to a worsening in pasture conditions for livestock and an increased use of alternative forages in the Richmond , Minneapolis , Kansas City , and Dallas districts . The alternative supplies seem to be generally available except for some reports of hay shortages in the Dallas district .

Manufacturing Typically , manufacturing conditions are similar throughout the District , but this year growth rates appear erratic between the northern and southern parts of the District . The northern region , which had reported deceleration in growth and only modest improvement in the last report , experienced strong growth during this survey period . Although the southern area reported strong growth in April , reports suggested a slight contraction in May . Conditions throughout the District have fluctuated monthly between contraction and expansion . Automakers in the District reported significant amounts of overtime , with one plant reporting overtime during all seven weeks beginning April 15 , two reporting six weeks with overtime activity , and another reporting five weeks with overtime . No plants reported closing during the last half of April or the month of May . In the steel industry , reports ranged from `` fairly strong '' to `` very slow '' activity . In general , steelmakers that supply materials and parts to automakers reported strong conditions ; those that supply construction companies reported stable conditions ; and those that sell to others reported poor conditions ( others include oil , tubular goods , commercial aerospace , and power generation companies ) .

While steel producers still reported excess capacity in the industry , area contacts noted that capacity utilization has increased for most area plants . Retail Sales Area retailers continued to report mixed conditions .",0.3,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:49:44.6789003Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 374, 22994, 298, 5197, 1444, 28705, 28750, 28734, 304, 28705, 28782, 28734, 4153, 302, 3102, 9445, 6292, 842, 19663, 1378, 15633, 1944, 1200, 15186, 4331, 460, 3684, 5473, 272, 8207, 1200, 562, 456, 879, 6057, 7978, 4305, 1166, 1711, 1444, 272, 12727, 304, 12227, 5099, 302, 272, 8207, 842, 415, 12727, 4424, 1200, 690, 553, 5745, 1285, 7708, 352, 297, 6057, 304, 865, 23676, 14204, 297, 272, 1432, 2264, 1200, 8304, 2967, 6057, 1938, 456, 10911, 3216, 842, 5800, 272, 12227, 2698, 5745, 2967, 6057, 297, 3999, 1200, 7959, 8750, 264, 5543, 4188, 1774, 297, 2246, 842, 11884, 2065, 5473, 272, 8207, 506, 19363, 25473, 14890, 1444, 4188, 1774, 304, 11120, 842, 15939, 8774, 297, 272, 8207, 5745, 5864, 14838, 302, 754, 1536, 1200, 395, 624, 5100, 14438, 754, 1536, 1938, 544, 6671, 4587, 5398, 3999, 28705, 28740, 28782, 1200, 989, 14438, 3522, 4587, 395, 754, 1536, 6355, 1200, 304, 1698, 14438, 3359, 4587, 395, 754, 1536, 842, 1770, 9923, 5745, 12984, 1938, 272, 1432, 2795, 302, 3999, 442, 272, 2102, 302, 2246, 842, 560, 272, 9445, 4779, 1200, 7959, 408, 4185, 477, 5008, 11735, 2967, 9842, 298, 5008, 1215, 3944, 9842, 6355, 842, 560, 2952, 1200, 9445, 22016, 369, 8002, 7069, 304, 5099, 298, 4607, 8774, 5745, 2967, 4331, 2753, 1395, 369, 8002, 6380, 4799, 5745, 11311, 4331, 2753, 304, 1395, 369, 6112, 298, 2663, 5745, 5366, 4331, 325, 2663, 3024, 5503, 1200, 11988, 1098, 11282, 1200, 7380, 264, 10667, 2644, 1200, 304, 1982, 8342, 4799, 1143, 842, 13, 13, 23475, 9445, 22862, 1309, 5745, 11454, 8444, 297, 272, 4779, 1200, 2698, 20075, 8659, 369, 8444, 4479, 1837, 659, 7483, 354, 1080, 2698, 9923, 842, 8337, 614, 16377, 14488, 11603, 404, 5317, 298, 2264, 9430, 4331, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28770, 28752], 'total_duration': 2608879100, 'load_duration': 8032600, 'prompt_eval_count': 353, 'prompt_eval_duration': 973752000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1623560000}"

Banks that did experience volume increases suggested that the gains were due to market share shifts rather than a general increase in demand . On balance , banks did not appear to be tightening standards on business loans , and there were a few reports that overall business loan quality had improved slightly . Prices and Employment Costs There were a few new reports of increasing input costs , but retail price increases remained largely subdued . Of particular concern to many contacts were rising prices of energy and inputs derived from petroleum . One contact said that prices for diesel fuel had risen to `` frighteningly high '' levels , which could potentially send some small freight carriers into bankruptcy . By contrast , steel prices were said to be stabilizing after some significant increases in 2002 . There were no new reports of intensifying pressure on wages , and some companies were said to have delayed merit increases until later in the year .

563,"September 3 , 2003 Economic growth in the Fifth District picked up in late July and August , although manufacturing activity weakened somewhat . Retailers generally reported higher sales , particularly at automobile dealerships and home improvement stores . Services businesses recorded a noticeable improvement in revenues as well , although employment growth in the sector remained subpar . The District 's manufacturing sector wobbled , however , weakened by further declines in production and employment , especially in the textiles and furniture industries . In addition , manufacturers trimmed their forecasts for shipments and capacity utilization for the remainder of the year . In housing , rising mortgage interest rates brought a decline in residential mortgage refinancings , but home sales and housing starts continued to be strong . On District farms , incessant rain delayed small grain harvests and thwarted hay production in some areas , but assisted corn and soybean development . Retail Fifth District retailers generally reported higher revenues in the weeks since our last report . Automobile sales were particularly strong -- dealers in Virginia and the Carolinas said business was brisk and they expected sales to remain strong through the end of the year .

In addition , manufacturing activity and energy activity continued to increase , and agriculture and tourism remained solid . Housing activity eased slightly but was still strong , while commercial real estate remained weak . Wage and price pressures increased slightly but remained modest . Consumer SpendingConsumer spending in the district improved somewhat in late July and August after flattening in the previous survey . A majority of retailers reported increases in sales from earlier in the summer , while only a handful of stores reported declines . Sales were also above year-ago levels at most stores . Among product categories , sales of back-to-school items—including children 's apparel—were up solidly from previous years , and sales of home furnishings were generally reported as strong . A few stores , however , noted some reluctance by consumers to purchase big ticket or luxury items . Most store managers were satisfied with inventory levels .

Consumer Spending Non-auto retail sales in the district were solid in January and February , as most stores reported moderate increases from a year ago . Among product categories , sales were particularly strong for most kinds of apparel and home improvement items . With the recent solid sales , most store managers were satisfied with inventory levels and planned typical increases in stocks heading into spring . Most managers remain optimistic that solid year-over-year sales growth will continue in coming months , and some stores plan modest increases in hiring .

579,"September 8 , 2004 Reports from the Federal Reserve Banks indicated that economic activity continued to expand in late July and August , although several districts indicated that the pace had slowed since their last reports . Districts ' characterizations of the rate of expansion ranged from slow ( St. Louis ) to solid ( San Francisco ) , with many districts reporting modest or moderate growth . Household spending was reported to have softened in many parts of the nation , reflecting lackluster retail sales and some cooling in new and existing home sales . Conditions in the manufacturing sector , on the other hand , improved further nationwide , especially among capital equipment and other durable goods makers . Residential construction activity remained at high levels but slowed a bit in some regions ; nonresidential construction remained tepid , as did demand for commercial and industrial space . Agricultural conditions were mixed and generally tied to the weather . Demand for consumer loans softened somewhat , but several districts noted increased commercial lending . Employers in most districts continued to expand payrolls , though districts reported some unevenness across sectors . While persistently rapid increases in nonwage labor costs continued to be a concern for many employers , wage pressures remained modest . Consumer prices were generally flat or up modestly , although there were noticeable price increases for energy and some material inputs .

Manhattan 's office market was little changed overall , as continued gradual improvement in Midtown Manhattan offset an upturn in vacancies in Lower Manhattan . Outside New York City , conditions were also mixed : Long Island 's vacancy rate declined for the fourth consecutive quarter , falling to a three-year low , but northern New Jersey 's vacancy rate climbed to 18 percent , the highest level in nearly a decade . Rates were virtually unchanged in New York City 's northern suburbs -- Fairfield and Westchester Counties .

However , respondents in some areas expressed concern that higher fuel prices could damp leisure travel this summer , especially to destinations that rely primarily on visits by automobile . Manufacturing District manufacturers saw further solid increases in production and sales across a wide range of products . Demand for semiconductors was very strong , keeping inventories low and further raising capacity utilization . Some makers of machine tools faced rising order backlogs due to rapid demand growth . Strong housing starts and rising demand for packaging materials fueled robust sales and firmer prices for wood panels , pulp , and paper . District apparel makers saw rising orders and inventories remained lean . The main exception to strong conditions was in the commercial aircraft sector , where orders remained somewhat weak and employment counts fell a bit further . More generally , rising demand has prompted some manufacturers to increase hiring , and a machine tool manufacturer in the Pacific Northwest noted growing difficulties finding qualified labor for available openings .

Another factor buoying property values is rising construction costs .

Some retailers cite recent reductions in consumer spending resulting from high gasoline prices , which they predicted earlier , but had not yet observed six or 12 weeks ago . Manufacturers are facing cost increases , but vary considerably in their ability to raise their own prices . Residential real estate markets in New England are becoming `` more reasonable '' as they cool slightly from record highs . Retail Retail respondents in the First District report mixed results for the quarter ending in September . While the quarter 's sales were mostly ahead of year-earlier levels , several contacts note a marked slowdown in the closing weeks . According to one contact in the apparel industry , same-store sales were up more than 4 percent in the third quarter partly due to better merchandising decisions , but year-to-date sales are virtually unchanged from last year .

Producers of stone , clay and glass reported sales declines of as much as 20 percent from a year ago , and inventories are up for some products . Lumber producers reported a significant drop in demand and increase in inventory over the past month , mostly because of reduced demand from national markets , although sales in Texas were also weaker .

Several Districts characterized the overall pace of economic growth as `` moderate '' or `` modest , '' although San Francisco reported that its economic expansion remained `` solid '' and Atlanta and St. Louis described overall conditions as `` mixed . '' The Philadelphia , Cleveland , Richmond , Chicago , Dallas , and San Francisco reports each highlighted a decline in the overall rate of economic growth in their Districts . Most reports on retail sales indicated slightly weaker conditions , on balance , than earlier in the year . But tourist spending remained robust , albeit with evidence of slower growth in some areas , and activity expanded for providers of nonfinancial services to businesses and consumers . Reports from the manufacturing sector were strong , with significant gains in output and sales , especially for durable goods .

Many contacts report that turmoil in financial markets is obscuring their near-term outlook . Price pressures are said to have eased somewhat , while selected professional and technical workers remain in short supply . Retail Retailers in the First District report mixed sales results during the summer months . Same-store sales ranged from low double-digit decreases to single-digit increases . Furniture , apparel and accessories , and computers were among the items that reportedly sold well . Inventory levels are mixed , while headcounts are generally stable ( except in connection with store openings ) . Capital spending is also varied , with several retailers reporting slight increases in spending levels because of acquisitions , store openings , and systems upgrades . Contrary to recent periods , most contacts cite decreased vendor price pressure , with the exception of paper and some metals . One contact says excess supplies of lumber have pushed prices down . Selling prices are generally stable . Respondents are cautious though optimistic in their outlook ; most expressed concern with consumer confidence going forward .

In the metropolitan areas of Boston , Hartford , and Providence , office rent growth appears close to zero after concessions are taken into account . The industrial property market has been very weak in both Connecticut and Rhode Island -- in the latter case , vacancies are up and rents are down ( both modestly ) compared to last year . Sales activity is limited as credit remains very tight and buyers and sellers hold out for their preferred prices . Investment sales and new construction have been hit particularly hard . For example , three major building projects in downtown Boston ( office and mixed-use high rises ) are said to be currently languishing as they scramble to obtain tenant commitments and financing . As evidence that property valuations have fallen relative to operating incomes , sources report that capitalization rates for commercial property in greater Boston are now approaching 7 percent , up from last summer 's estimated 5 percent . Despite enjoying brisk business and high commercial mortgage interest rates , a small Boston mutual bank foresees that it could run up against lending capacity constraints before year 's end . Accordingly , lending officers at the bank have been instructed to adopt a `` more selective '' stance .

In the financial sector , several contacts in the mortgage industry reported pressure on margins for residential mortgages from recent pricing increases in the secondary market . Wage pressures remained limited outside of skilled labor positions that continue to experience shortages . Agriculture Crop conditions improved in the District as sufficient moisture remained from earlier rains to offset dry weather in August . Replanted fields may boost soybean production above current published estimates . Contacts reported that corn and soybean fields were at least two weeks behind the typical stages of development , making crop yields more vulnerable than usual to an early frost . Concerns about risks for 2009 grew as farmers faced higher planting costs while having fewer options to lock in prices for their crops . These circumstances have led parties in transactions to more fully investigate the financial health of their counterparties . Hay supplies improved with new cuttings , and pastures were in good shape . Corn and soybean prices fell during the reporting period . However , livestock producers still struggled with high feed costs . Hog producers benefited from higher hog prices .

Lower corn prices eased margins for several ethanol producers reducing delays and allowing some new plants to start production .",0.3,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:55:21.3618492Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 28723, 1387, 654, 835, 2856, 7959, 302, 1455, 28733, 14968, 302, 1167, 4337, 6966, 298, 1060, 3888, 8506, 1200, 389, 10943, 298, 264, 1215, 6516, 11125, 354, 17909, 1259, 390, 18350, 6380, 304, 11603, 6226, 842, 560, 272, 5593, 9642, 1200, 2856, 20075, 297, 272, 18222, 4779, 5745, 6403, 356, 15003, 1126, 354, 18350, 5461, 28721, 1291, 477, 5391, 22419, 12095, 297, 272, 13461, 2668, 842, 394, 465, 2944, 1238, 7568, 6516, 3536, 302, 20799, 7579, 9161, 369, 3688, 298, 2659, 2485, 1291, 842, 23837, 482, 334, 1506, 4331, 11957, 297, 272, 8207, 390, 9406, 28224, 7568, 477, 5585, 408, 1606, 298, 4470, 6964, 8086, 297, 3628, 842, 1298, 452, 7266, 5080, 993, 10974, 579, 28724, 16504, 4885, 2747, 1868, 4775, 16438, 842, 2999, 9664, 5745, 369, 16869, 304, 579, 28724, 16504, 5080, 654, 438, 2429, 989, 4587, 2910, 272, 10842, 15360, 302, 4099, 1200, 2492, 21948, 18934, 680, 17508, 821, 8434, 298, 396, 2935, 8169, 303, 842, 1325, 28717, 1173, 28713, 684, 14679, 354, 28705, 28750, 28734, 28734, 28774, 8108, 390, 17130, 12565, 4337, 5100, 288, 6966, 1312, 2461, 16130, 2877, 298, 4344, 297, 8506, 354, 652, 27152, 842, 2957, 10139, 506, 4163, 8209, 297, 15852, 298, 680, 5894, 17214, 272, 5593, 2528, 302, 652, 5573, 1732, 497, 842, 11411, 13679, 11957, 395, 633, 3119, 2549, 1200, 304, 2609, 1238, 654, 297, 1179, 5843, 842, 12506, 304, 579, 28724, 16504, 8506, 5970, 1938, 272, 14438, 3216, 842, 2993, 1200, 9678, 374, 629, 22862, 1309, 19274, 395, 1486, 5575, 6966, 842, 382, 476, 22862, 3749, 1345, 477, 4337, 295, 476, 8506, 842, 13, 13, 12592, 16869, 8506, 317, 1293, 15003, 1126, 354, 2856, 7511, 276, 328, 22862, 17032, 882, 748, 304, 9836, 741, 633, 9923, 298, 1149, 4885, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28770, 28752], 'total_duration': 2700252200, 'load_duration': 6734000, 'prompt_eval_count': 354, 'prompt_eval_duration': 978587000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1712896000}"

Residential construction declined further and nonresidential construction showed signs of slowing . Manufacturing activity weakened slightly . Consumer lending declined , while business lending was stable . Cost pressures from rising material and energy prices remained high , while wage pressures continued to be low . Flooding and cool weather further set back crop conditions in June , although they improved toward the end of the month and in early July . Consumer Spending Consumer spending was mixed since the previous reporting period . Federal tax rebates and increased discounting boosted retail sales , but spending on automobiles slowed . Consumers continued to tighten their budgets in response to higher food and energy prices . Spending on discretionary items such as furniture , apparel , and electronics decreased and gasoline consumption fell , while food service sales were flat . Higher fuel prices discouraged travel , leading to a slowdown in tourism . Tourism was also adversely affected by inclement weather and flooding in some areas of the District .

Transportation service contacts in cargo and container trade reported a recent pickup in demand and were hopeful this was a sign that the economy was bottoming out . Still volumes remain well below year-ago levels . Intermodal cargo volumes rose slightly over the past month as export demand improved , and contacts said water-based container trade volume increased . Railroad respondents said volumes declined across the board following a pickup noted in the last survey . The railroad industry outlook remained grim for 2009 , but contacts said it looked like the economy was bouncing along the bottom . Construction and Real Estate Homebuilders reported a slight uptick in sales . Much of the demand is focused on the lower-priced entry-level market , and one large company said the first-time homebuyer tax credit was responsible for about 80 percent of their current business . There was some concern about the November expiration of the program , however , as buyers have just begun to come off the sidelines .

Reduced global demand and lower prices for oil have prompted a sharp cutback in oil extraction activity since last fall , with Dallas noting an `` unprecedented '' decline in the domestic rig count that was largely concentrated in their District . Respondents from the Kansas City District expect oil extraction activity to fall further as the year proceeds , and Minneapolis noted that natural gas and mining activities also faltered during the reporting period . Prices and Wages Upward price pressures were very limited during the reporting period , as a result of lower energy and commodity prices and weak demand for final goods and services across a wide range of sectors . The lower prices of energy and raw materials generally were passed on and contributed to downward pressure on the final prices of various products , according to Chicago and Dallas . Prices dropped on selected retail items in the Philadelphia , Kansas City , and San Francisco Districts , as discounting was widespread . Selected food products were a notable exception to downward price pressures , with Philadelphia reporting that some food processors raised their product prices . Gas prices rose , but according to Chicago and San Francisco the increase was not large enough to substantially offset the ongoing effects of the net decline from last year 's highs .

Upward wage pressures eased in all Districts , as a rising incidence of hiring freezes and continued job cuts increased the degree of labor market slack .

San Francisco reported that despite some pickup in recent months , home sales continued to be quite slow in most parts of the District . In the New York District , the market for new homes continued to weaken in New Jersey , and the higher-priced housing markets nearest to New York City were characterized as especially weak . While the Minneapolis District reported that late December saw an up-tick in residential sale activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area , it was reportedly driven by foreclosures and short sales . Increased home sale cancellations were common in a few Districts . Contacts in the Dallas District reported that home sale cancellations remained prevalent , in some cases outpacing sales . Elevated cancellation rates and weak showroom traffic in the Chicago District led developers to remain cautious about expanding inventory levels , and some building contractors in the Cleveland District reported increased inventories because of take-backs from home sales that fell through .

That said , many of these plans involve spending outside the United States .

Software and Information Technology Services New England software and information technology services contacts generally report weaker-than-expected activity through October , with revenues in the third quarter roughly on par with year-earlier levels .

Gains continue among the makers of food products , lumber and wood products , fabricated metals , industrial machinery , and instruments . Firms in the primary metals and electronic equipment industries report a fall-off in demand .

Except for primary metals , optimism is present in all major sectors . Firms seem relatively divided as to whether high energy costs are a concern , depending largely on their ability to pass the cost along to their customers . New to the list of concerns and uncertainties about the outlook is the increasing worry that political gridlock will lead to large cuts in defense-related production through sequestration .

750,"February 29 , 2012 Overall , business activity in the Third District has grown at a somewhat faster pace compared with the previous Beige Book . The overall sentiment has been more positive , although the very mild winter weather may have played a part . Since the last Beige Book , manufacturing activity has grown further with more broad sectors contributing to the gain . Retail sales maintained steady year-over-year increases . Motor vehicle dealers experienced unseasonably strong sales growth overall ; however , results varied by state . Third District banks have reported slight growth in lending and continued improvement of credit quality since the last Beige Book . New home construction started the year strong with the warm weather assist . Commercial real estate contacts continued to report steadily improving markets for industrial , retail , and office space . Overall , service-sector firms reported continued growth . Price pressures have remained contained for most sectors , with little change from the last Beige Book . Most firms have expressed a brighter outlook since the last Beige Book . Manufacturers anticipate rising shipments and orders during the next six months . Retailers expect slightly stronger sales , and auto dealers are increasingly confident that the current surge in sales will carry into the spring selling season .

Healthcare consultants cite the strongest results , as the double-digit revenue growth of the past few years continues . Demand for healthcare consulting services is driven by increased merger and acquisition activity among providers , adoption of new technology , compliance with new regulations , and the need for organizational change due to structural shifts in the healthcare industry . Demand for economic consulting remains strong , and strategy consultants report that `` the economy is slowly picking up steam . '' Marketing contacts estimate industry-wide growth of 6 percent to 7 percent , driven by large corporate orders and a shift in demand towards higher-value items as companies have more to spend on marketing and branding . By contrast , a government consultant reports a slight drop in revenues and a smaller backlog as the sequester continues to reduce agencies ' ability to purchase services .

According to contacts , slight increases in interest rates will likely spur more buyer activity in the short term as households try to lock in historically low interest rates . In Massachusetts , particularly in the Greater Boston area , inventory levels remain low , placing upward pressure on prices . Contacts in the Greater Boston area caution that inventory remains the most significant constraint on sales growth . In other parts of the First District , smaller cities report depleting inventory levels in urban centers , though realtors in these areas feel that a sufficient number of homes are available to satisfy prospective buyers . In contrast to much of the region , Rhode Island maintains a high level of inventory , but that market appears to be recovering as sales activity and prices continue to increase . Contacts expect sales activity and the median sale price to continue their upward trend . Inventory levels will likely remain an issue in urban areas due to a lack of new construction there . Contacts anticipate that homeowners may be more inclined to list their home for sale as house values continue to appreciate . Overall , contacts feel the market remains poised for healthy growth in the coming months .",0.8,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:59:41.8618066Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.8}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 16965, 5473, 272, 4205, 8207, 297, 2246, 842, 2999, 9664, 297, 272, 4424, 2264, 2967, 5637, 354, 11821, 1200, 6311, 297, 12270, 5020, 302, 1450, 5783, 842, 6586, 298, 20075, 1200, 5543, 12095, 297, 2145, 7978, 622, 3917, 668, 324, 680, 24861, 6355, 297, 272, 2485, 1850, 390, 23755, 1464, 298, 4344, 297, 4264, 1944, 2859, 2145, 7978, 842, 560, 16255, 1200, 6311, 297, 272, 9261, 795, 9143, 2698, 1200, 19930, 6157, 6344, 2859, 1200, 20632, 25246, 6403, 356, 8506, 842, 2999, 9664, 297, 272, 9261, 795, 9143, 2698, 26769, 369, 19930, 7520, 272, 1080, 5864, 17656, 356, 6292, 6057, 842, 560, 799, 5099, 302, 272, 4205, 8207, 1200, 7000, 9245, 2264, 340, 792, 1157, 19930, 6157, 297, 12270, 18015, 1200, 2070, 1353, 28707, 734, 297, 1167, 5020, 1601, 369, 264, 9406, 1474, 302, 9039, 460, 2632, 298, 15836, 11450, 495, 21872, 842, 560, 9349, 298, 1188, 302, 272, 4424, 1200, 10282, 573, 7633, 5384, 1606, 264, 1486, 2184, 302, 19930, 1200, 562, 369, 2668, 8045, 298, 347, 9443, 288, 390, 6292, 6355, 304, 8506, 3688, 298, 5247, 842, 2999, 9664, 1675, 6292, 6355, 304, 272, 16825, 7796, 4144, 298, 3688, 652, 25246, 9156, 842, 560, 16917, 6157, 622, 3917, 6344, 396, 4291, 297, 12270, 5020, 2940, 298, 264, 5502, 302, 633, 6380, 736, 842, 2999, 9664, 12595, 380, 369, 1611, 24689, 993, 347, 680, 27115, 298, 1274, 652, 1611, 354, 7796, 390, 2134, 3069, 3688, 298, 11982, 842, 21013, 1200, 20075, 1601, 272, 2668, 7520, 1627, 2458, 354, 7783, 6057, 297, 272, 3524, 3370, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28783, 28752], 'total_duration': 2625386700, 'load_duration': 7476400, 'prompt_eval_count': 321, 'prompt_eval_duration': 898881000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1717274000}"

He believes that this reluctance may put downward pressure on the housing industry for years to come . New home contracts were found mostly in the mid- to higher-price-point categories . Demand for multifamily housing remains strong . Builders expressed confidence that the turnaround in the housing market will persist in the upcoming months .

Nonresidential builders told us that while inquiries have weakened , there were still a large number of projects in the development phase . However , backlogs are lower than what most builders would like . The strongest activity was in multifamily housing , energy , and manufacturing .

Contacts in New Hampshire and Rhode Island cite declines in sales of single family homes , while Massachusetts experienced no change , and respondents in Connecticut , Maine , and Vermont cite increases in sales relative to December 2012 . Scarce inventory is said to be the most significant constraint on the growth of sales , while uncertainty from new qualified mortgage rules and flood insurance reforms are also believed to be causing buyers to remain cautious about making offers . Contacts in Connecticut say that sales are being affected by weak consumer confidence and a shortage of stable employment opportunities . Median sale prices increased year-over-year in four of the six New England states , decreasing only in Connecticut and Vermont . In Massachusetts , particularly in the Greater Boston area , price appreciation driven by low inventory levels has become a concern as realtors caution that high prices could keep first time home buyers out of the market . Pending sales suggest the market for single family houses and condos is off to a good start in 2014 , increasing in all states except Rhode Island . Contacts express optimism about local housing markets looking forward but say they expect the snowy winter to depress sales in the near term .",0.3,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T03:00:43.0786558Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.3}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 12483, 9626, 304, 2076, 15257, 1962, 28713, 297, 4925, 842, 2999, 9664, 297, 1450, 27616, 304, 10282, 573, 7633, 277, 570, 3800, 1303, 297, 6292, 302, 2692, 2005, 9039, 1200, 1312, 16255, 8304, 708, 2268, 1200, 304, 9421, 788, 297, 23998, 1200, 23579, 1200, 304, 19191, 677, 277, 570, 12095, 297, 6292, 7986, 298, 4925, 28705, 28750, 28734, 28740, 28750, 842, 23147, 358, 19930, 349, 773, 298, 347, 272, 1080, 5864, 17656, 356, 272, 6057, 302, 6292, 1200, 1312, 18110, 477, 633, 14786, 18222, 5879, 304, 17268, 6919, 9861, 28713, 460, 835, 7761, 298, 347, 13098, 21872, 298, 6344, 13831, 925, 684, 2492, 5751, 842, 2999, 9664, 297, 23998, 1315, 369, 6292, 460, 1250, 11180, 486, 6334, 12077, 9843, 304, 264, 2485, 465, 302, 11311, 14087, 8812, 842, 2998, 753, 7796, 8506, 7483, 879, 28733, 1483, 28733, 4395, 297, 2308, 302, 272, 3522, 1450, 5783, 4605, 1200, 8512, 3706, 865, 297, 23998, 304, 19191, 677, 842, 560, 16255, 1200, 6311, 297, 272, 9261, 795, 9143, 2698, 1200, 4144, 26020, 12215, 486, 2859, 19930, 6157, 659, 2727, 264, 4368, 390, 1353, 28707, 734, 26769, 369, 1486, 8506, 829, 1840, 907, 727, 1611, 21872, 575, 302, 272, 2668, 842, 367, 2570, 6292, 3397, 272, 2668, 354, 2692, 2005, 9626, 304, 2076, 385, 349, 805, 298, 264, 1179, 1149, 297, 28705, 28750, 28734, 28740, 28781, 1200, 6488, 297, 544, 4605, 3741, 10282, 573, 7633, 842, 2999, 9664, 4072, 6997, 1443, 684, 1862, 11821, 11574, 2526, 3814, 562, 1315, 590, 1675, 272, 7899, 28724, 8539, 298, 28285, 6292, 297, 272, 3065, 1850, 842, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28770, 28752], 'total_duration': 2457135200, 'load_duration': 6852200, 'prompt_eval_count': 324, 'prompt_eval_duration': 897923000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1548591000}"

The travel and tourism sector saw increased activity in January 2015 over January 2014 , but lost business in late January and February because of severe winter weather . The weather conditions also had ripple effects for food suppliers , delivery workers , and wait staff . A contact estimates that restaurant revenues in the Boston area were down 30 percent to 40 percent during this period , reflecting lost traffic from corporate travelers , regional leisure travelers , and weekend business from local residents . Museums and other attractions were down 6 percent for 2015 : Q1 compared to 2014 : Q1 . The good news is that , on balance , corporate and leisure travel is expected to be up again in 2015 , leading to increases in room rates and occupancy rates in area hotels . Manufacturing and Related Services Eleven of twelve contacted manufacturers report higher sales than a year ago ; the exception was a maker of hardwood furniture which saw an 18 percent year-over-year decline in sales . Although the firm attributes some of the weakness to this winter 's severe weather , the decline prompted the permanent closing of several showrooms .

Overall , yield reports suggest that the corn harvest wo n't reach last year 's record level , while the soybean harvest may surpass last year 's record . Corn prices moved up and were higher than a year ago , while soybean prices moved down and were lower than a year ago . Because of a wide range in yields and differing rental arrangements , the profitability of crop operations ranged from substantial losses to just breaking-even .

Current capital expenditures continued to grow at a moderate pace , as did expectations for future spending . Outlays were primarily for replacing industrial and IT equipment . Hiring picked up to a moderate rate , and contacts expect hiring to continue at a moderate rate over the next six to twelve months . Many contacts noted that the labor market continues to tighten . Demand remained strong for skilled workers , particularly for many professional and technical occupations , sales , and skilled manufacturing and building trades . Contacts also indicated that competition continued to grow for lower-skilled workers .

Turnover was mixed across the region ; however , any time turnover occurred , firms pursued opportunities to increase operational efficiencies by evaluating whether to fold one job into another , replace position ( s ) with technology , and/or shift the salary towards training and development of other employees . Firms continued to implement various methods to attract and retain top talent , often in lieu of wage increases . Contacts shared that in addition to offering flexible work hours and locations , more vacation time , and training and education opportunities , they were increasingly focused on social responsibility initiatives and support systems to encourage work-life harmony . Some contacts indicated that these non-wage compensation mechanisms were losing their effectiveness , thus broad wage increases were expected in the near term . Some firms noted increased offerings of early retirement packages in an attempt to lower overall compensation costs ( replace higher-paid , tenured workers with technology or lower-paid , entry to mid-level workers ) .

The number of active oil and gas drilling rigs continued to pick up modestly across the District . Oil prices rose moderately to reach eighteen-month highs after OPEC announced a lower oil production target in late November 2016 . However , the majority of survey contacts expected actual production to exceed the target . Most firms projected U.S. oil production to be above previous forecasts due to continued expectations of higher oil prices . Natural gas prices were slightly higher due to strong seasonal demand . Local firms expected natural gas prices to be near current levels through 2017 , but not high enough to substantially increase drilling activity . Agriculture Farm income expectations weakened slightly as most agricultural commodity prices remained lower than a year ago . In the livestock sector , cattle prices declined from the previous year due to growing inventories , and hog prices also remained lower than year-ago levels . In the crop sector , large corn and wheat inventories kept prices subdued , but strong yields in some areas helped to offset losses from low prices .

867,"main issue is a shortage of drivers . Manufacturing respondents had a positive outlook . In general , contacts were increasing capital expenditures , although only one reported a major increase in spending ( to build a new plant in New Hampshire ) . Contacts said that it was too soon to determine the effect of the new tax code on capital spending . Staffing Services New England staffing firms have seen mostly negative results over the last quarter of 2017 and the start of 2018 , with the majority reporting revenue declines year-over-year . For most respondents , this reflects a low unemployment environment that has slowed hiring volumes and increased competition for the remaining labor supply . Some also remarked on the entry of new tech firms specializing in job posting sites , which has made it easier for companies to host job searches without using intermediaries . This has sparked experimentation as they look for ways to distinguish themselves through advertising , branding , improving online reviews , and increased attention to building relationships with potential talent . One respondent reported the temporary placement side of their business was the strongest , while most noted that few workers want temporary positions in the current labor market .

Contacts noted that demand for hotel rooms continued to be robust even though the window for bookings has become shorter as a result of the increased usage of smartphone travel apps where travelers can take advantage of lower room rates for last minute travel plans . On balance , business sentiment among travel and hospitality contacts is cautiously optimistic for 2019 . Construction and Real Estate Reports from District brokers and homebuilders came in slightly more optimistic than the previous report as activity moved into the early stages of the spring selling season . The recent moderation in mortgage rates was cited as helping to alleviate some of the pressure on housing affordability in the District . Though still flat or down from a year ago , existing home sales in many markets across the District improved at the start of 2019 from lows experienced at the close of 2018 . Inventory levels , albeit increasing on a year-over-year basis , remained low in most markets . Home price appreciation continued to moderate as weaker year-over-year sales and slightly rising inventory levels created less upward pressure on prices .

Retailers reported mixed but mostly positive results , while restaurateurs saw solid revenue gains . Most manufacturers experienced revenue increases ranging from mid single-digit percentages to more than 20 percent , but two respondents cited revenue declines , both attributed in part to disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak in China . Staffing firms continued to report moderate to strong revenue gains , although a couple cited slowing growth or fewer job requests compared with last year . Residential real estate markets remained tight in the region , with inventories of both homes and condos decreasing as sales and prices rose . Commercial real estate markets were mixed across sectors and locations . Outlooks continued to be positive , with the coronavirus and the presidential election cited as risk factors . Employment and Wages Labor markets in the First District remained tight . Retailers noted that minimum wages went up in some states ; those increases , in combination with a generally tight labor market , have pushed up operating costs . Employment increased year-over-year at five contacted manufacturing firms ; headcount was down modestly year-over-year at one manufacturer and flat at four .

Almost all the manufacturers who were actively hiring reported difficulties finding workers for nearly all positions ranging from skilled executive assistants to experienced wood-workers and engineers ; competition was said to be particularly fierce for higher skilled jobs in northern",0.7,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T03:06:14.1291607Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.7}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 28755, 1161, 28705, 28781, 1200, 28705, 28750, 28734, 28750, 28734, 23276, 302, 20451, 24066, 4205, 8207, 18253, 5317, 298, 2264, 12095, 297, 6638, 6355, 13573, 778, 28705, 28750, 28734, 28750, 28734, 842, 8337, 614, 404, 5745, 9430, 562, 7444, 5278, 2903, 1200, 1312, 6438, 19371, 2672, 6861, 14008, 21722, 842, 4822, 19245, 8304, 14008, 12095, 22741, 477, 4725, 2692, 28733, 7845, 279, 4153, 1291, 298, 680, 821, 28705, 28750, 28734, 4153, 1200, 562, 989, 9421, 788, 22881, 14008, 3800, 1303, 1200, 1560, 26133, 297, 744, 298, 704, 551, 1720, 5202, 298, 272, 18167, 22397, 26030, 297, 5077, 842, 13594, 288, 18253, 5317, 298, 2264, 22651, 298, 2967, 14008, 21722, 1200, 5432, 264, 4308, 22881, 3944, 288, 6057, 442, 16130, 2389, 9828, 6731, 395, 1432, 879, 842, 1992, 27357, 1353, 9490, 11574, 7568, 6975, 297, 272, 4424, 1200, 395, 9182, 2420, 302, 1560, 9039, 304, 2076, 385, 8512, 3706, 390, 6292, 304, 8506, 8536, 842, 24551, 1353, 9490, 11574, 654, 9430, 2673, 23014, 304, 11293, 842, 4655, 5819, 28713, 5317, 298, 347, 5278, 1200, 395, 272, 18167, 22397, 304, 272, 19268, 7537, 22881, 390, 4623, 8612, 842, 2929, 9129, 304, 394, 1291, 14160, 11574, 297, 272, 4205, 8207, 7568, 6975, 842, 8337, 614, 404, 8659, 369, 7968, 24110, 2068, 582, 297, 741, 4605, 2753, 1395, 12095, 1200, 297, 9470, 395, 264, 6741, 6975, 7579, 2668, 1200, 506, 9012, 582, 10513, 6966, 842, 2929, 9129, 7483, 879, 28733, 1483, 28733, 4395, 438, 3359, 28330, 15186, 18253, 2753, 1335, 2114, 403, 1060, 968, 19067, 879, 28733, 1483, 28733, 4395, 438, 624, 17746, 304, 7007, 438, 2308, 842, 13, 13, 2707, 2284, 544, 272, 19245, 693, 654, 18639, 21349, 5745, 19316, 7484, 7433, 354, 5597, 544, 9161, 22741, 477, 20799, 12212, 6031, 1549, 298, 8304, 4768, 28733, 28256, 304, 22488, 2753, 8995, 403, 773, 298, 347, 6311, 27118, 354, 4337, 20799, 7794, 297, 12727, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28787, 28752], 'total_duration': 2582572800, 'load_duration': 7080200, 'prompt_eval_count': 375, 'prompt_eval_duration': 983326000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1590011000}"

Business operations increased incrementally , as COVID-19 caseloads remained at relatively low levels throughout the period . As firms recalled more of their workforce , net employment also grew modestly ; however , firms also continued to issue permanent layoffs . Some wage increases were noted among lower-paying jobs . Meanwhile , contacts reported ongoing difficulties attracting workers . Prices edged higher again amid continued spotty price spikes . Firms maintained modestly positive expectations for growth over the next six months ; however , uncertainty is extremely high , as contacts worried about the end of stimulus measures , pending layoffs , and an inevitable rise of evictions , foreclosures , and bankruptcies . Looming over all is the active presence of the coronavirus . Employment and Wages Employment increased modestly overall as firms stepped up hiring and recalling workers ; however , layoffs continued as well . Among firms in our COVID-19 survey , 25 percent reported that they had hired new workers in July , and 13 percent recalled furloughed workers . Meanwhile , about 6 percent of the firms had laid off workers permanently , and another 6 percent had furloughed workers .

However , at mid-August , a slightly greater percentage of firms reported that employment had declined over the month than had increased .

926,"March 3 , 2021 Summary of Economic Activity The District 's economy regained momentum after it had slowed in the previous reporting period . Customer demand in the current period proved to be better than what contacts had expected , reflecting declining numbers of coronavirus infections and various fiscal relief measures . That said , activity remains below prepandemic levels for most firms . In addition , many firms , particularly those in construction , retail , and manufacturing , reported that delayed deliveries from suppliers and coronavirus-related employee outages constrained their output . Hiring activity was modest , even though customer demand improved , and wage pressures increased moderately . Nonlabor costs rose strongly as supply chain disruptions coincided with stronger demand for inputs . Selling prices rose moderately as firms attempted to keep up with mounting input costs . Looking ahead , contacts expected moderate improvement in customer demand over the next couple of months , and they expected stronger gains in the second half of the year as coronavirus vaccines are more widely distributed .

Growth in the manufacturing and nonfinancial services sectors picked up in early February after stalling in January , while retail activity remained flat . Unprecedented winter storms and widespread power outages in mid-February severely disrupted economic activity , though the impact is mostly expected to be transitory . The housing market continued to be a bright spot , with vigorous new home construction . Overall loan volume decreased slightly , though real estate lending continued to rise . Energy activity improved further . Employment rose and wages increased moderately . Marked price increases were seen in the manufacturing and retail sectors , due in part to supply chain disruptions . Outlooks were generally positive , but uncertainty persisted . Employment and Wages Employment was up overall , with solid hiring continuing in manufacturing and service-sector hiring picking up in February after easing in January . Employment reports were mixed in the energy sector , with some reporting lingering layoffs and others reporting hiring to meet needs for drilling and completion activity . Modest job losses were seen in the retail sector , where work hours also dipped .

Some firms reported short-term problems maintaining workflow while others closed temporarily amid widespread power outages and water problems from winter storms .

933,"March 3 , 2021 Summary of Economic Activity On balance , business activity in the Third District rebounded to a modest pace of growth during the current Beige Book period – the first significant growth since midsummer . However , activity in most sectors remained below levels observed prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic . Net employment appeared to rise slightly after falling slightly in the prior period . Positive wage and price growth trends increased to modest and moderate paces , respectively . Economic gains appeared to reflect waning COVID-19 cases and the relaxation of some business restrictions . However , firms continued to cite disruptions at production sites , consumer outlets , and along supply chains . Moreover , wintry weather conditions have constrained growth in several sectors . More than half of the firms expressed positive expectations for modest growth over the next six months – the percent broadened further among nonmanufacturing firms but narrowed among manufacturers . Employment and Wages Employment appeared to increase slightly overall – rebounding from a slight decrease in the prior period . The share of nonmanufacturing firms reporting employment increases for full-time employees just edged out those reporting decreases . Among the manufacturers , employment increases broadened to nearly one-third of the reporting firms , while reported job declines waned . Moreover , average hours worked rose for a larger share of all firms .

A few staffing agents expected wage growth for lower-paid workers to slow in the coming year , saying that businesses can not afford to pay much more . However , contacts expect wage pressures for higher-skilled workers to remain elevated . Prices Nonlabor input costs rose for most contacts . In a few instances , contacts noted that some costs , such as for steel , had stabilized or come down somewhat . However , such reports were the exceptions . Higher transportation costs were commonly cited as a major strain on firms . One manufacturer noted that freight costs had almost doubled in the past two months .

Contacts were optimistic that nonauto consumer spending on goods and services would pick up in the coming weeks as concerns about the Omicron variant abate , and multiple auto dealers expected sales to increase along with inventory levels in coming months . Manufacturing Manufacturing orders increased slightly from already high levels . Contacts noted that output was stifled by shortages of raw materials and workers . Aerospace equipment manufacturing continued to recover , but auto suppliers said that carmakers purchased less than they had expected because of shortages of microchips and other parts . High staff turnover and rising wages prompted some firms to spend more on labor-saving technology . That , in addition to increased overtime hours and alternative work arrangements ( for example , having non-floor staff step into hands-on roles ) allowed some firms to boost production . Most manufacturing contacts expected demand to increase in the coming months , although they expected supply chain disruptions to persist . Real Estate and Construction Housing demand remained strong despite rising home prices . One homebuilder compared current housing demand to a fever and noted that customers were buying houses at any price without pushback . An increasing number of homebuilders noted that demand has been so strong that they no longer have the capacity to build spec homes . In addition , supply chain difficulties impeded construction activity .

Contacts anticipated that housing demand would remain robust in the near term , although supply chain challenges would continue to constrain construction .

However , many contacts , including staffing firms , noted a slight easing of labor supply challenges in recent months , with more workers applying for open positions . One contact stated that some workers have explained that they had quit jobs because of poor management , unkept promises , or racist attitudes . Firms continued to note that wage growth subsided in recent months . However , wage inflation remains widespread and appears to have maintained a moderate pace . In our monthly surveys , the share of nonmanufacturing firms reporting higher wage and benefit costs per employee edged down but remained above 50 percent , as has been true for the past year . Few firms reported lower compensation . On a quarterly basis , firms reported a somewhat higher expectation of the one-year-ahead change in compensation cost per worker , with a trimmed mean of 5.8 percent in the third quarter of 2022 – up from 5.2 percent in the second quarter .

Trucking tonnage also fell , and housing-related freight was noted as particularly weak . Railroads experienced declines in intermodal shipments of packaging materials , chemicals , and metals .

974,"offset recent declines in spending by domestic travelers . Though overall consumer spending declined , businesses noted a bifurcation in spending patterns . Discretionary and more interest rate sensitive consumption categories – such as travel and car purchases – declined at a rapid pace , while spending on non-discretionary consumption categories – such as food , energy , and healthcare – increased modestly . Community Conditions Low to moderate income ( LMI ) households in the Tenth District reported greater difficulty securing adequate childcare over the past few months . Contacts cited both a lack of availability and rising costs at childcare facilities as the major barriers faced by households seeking care . Insufficient childcare availability and unaffordability continued to hinder workforce participation among LMI households . Recent policy efforts to improve childcare availability – for example , a recent zoning reform in Wichita , Kansas increased maximum home daycare capacity from 10 to 12 children – have reportedly been more than offset by an acceleration of closures of childcare facilities . Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Manufacturing businesses reported that overall activity remained mostly unchanged over the past few weeks . Higher prices supported revenues , but measures of real activity , including production , backlogs , and new orders , declined moderately .

Durable goods manufacturers reported more severe declines in production and expectations . Growth among services businesses was mixed across sectors . While retail and tourism businesses reported moderate declines in activity , professional businesses services , transportation , and healthcare businesses",0.2,"{'model': 'openchat', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T03:09:15.8764564Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": 0.2}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 1247, 28747, 2984, 16914, 6638, 21790, 356, 264, 387, 28740, 298, 28705, 28740, 5657, 395, 387, 28740, 1250, 1080, 7087, 304, 28705, 28740, 1080, 5278, 354, 2296, 1739, 3580, 5737, 2245, 28723, 4571, 272, 7420, 390, 264, 9292, 1192, 395, 264, 1945, 302, 21790, 304, 2511, 1112, 28747, 28705, 13, 3783, 5391, 3800, 1303, 297, 9981, 486, 12866, 4530, 404, 842, 10080, 7544, 12077, 9981, 23043, 1200, 8689, 8659, 264, 287, 335, 324, 28717, 352, 297, 9981, 11533, 842, 3433, 3927, 296, 628, 304, 680, 2145, 4338, 13509, 16298, 13187, 764, 1259, 390, 4530, 304, 1253, 25596, 764, 23043, 438, 264, 8421, 13681, 1200, 1312, 9981, 356, 1843, 28733, 2021, 3927, 296, 628, 16298, 13187, 764, 1259, 390, 2887, 1200, 3408, 1200, 304, 15240, 764, 7483, 968, 19067, 842, 11027, 11884, 2065, 13091, 298, 22651, 7904, 325, 393, 5877, 1143, 23755, 297, 272, 320, 8016, 8207, 5745, 6517, 14426, 22214, 288, 23193, 1502, 8001, 754, 272, 2609, 1664, 3370, 842, 2999, 9664, 22881, 1560, 264, 5502, 302, 18858, 304, 11862, 6966, 438, 1502, 8001, 11675, 390, 272, 3014, 27222, 12565, 486, 23755, 11246, 1656, 842, 9513, 23885, 1502, 8001, 18858, 304, 1849, 496, 556, 2437, 5317, 298, 295, 5052, 771, 5712, 17002, 3352, 393, 5877, 23755, 842, 27727, 4920, 8280, 298, 4916, 1502, 8001, 18858, 764, 354, 2757, 1200, 264, 5391, 686, 20392, 9861, 297, 394, 539, 3156, 1200, 17778, 7483, 7228, 1611, 1370, 8001, 8444, 477, 28705, 28740, 28734, 298, 28705, 28740, 28750, 2436, 764, 506, 5745, 346, 750, 680, 821, 4470, 486, 396, 13057, 352, 302, 3377, 1238, 302, 1502, 8001, 11675, 842, 19663, 1378, 304, 5299, 7711, 24066, 19663, 1378, 8689, 5745, 369, 7544, 6355, 7568, 7444, 521, 11247, 754, 272, 2609, 1664, 4587, 842, 14327, 663, 8506, 6615, 15283, 1139, 1200, 562, 10582, 302, 1353, 6355, 1200, 2490, 4885, 1200, 852, 25850, 1200, 304, 633, 8636, 1200, 23043, 11323, 1999, 842, 13, 13, 28757, 17499, 11282, 19245, 5745, 680, 13645, 3800, 1303, 297, 4885, 304, 13879, 842, 18456, 362, 3352, 3345, 8689, 403, 9430, 2673, 23014, 842, 4023, 11603, 304, 3884, 1443, 8689, 5745, 22651, 3800, 1303, 297, 6355, 1200, 5024, 8689, 3345, 1200, 17408, 1200, 304, 15240, 8689, 32000, 420, 6316, 28781, 3198, 3123, 21631, 28747, 6799, 16788, 2487, 1264, 28705, 28734, 28723, 28750, 28752], 'total_duration': 2673521800, 'load_duration': 7005000, 'prompt_eval_count': 378, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1012822000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 1649962000}"

Most contacts within the banking industry confirmed a tightening of lending standards or that discussions were ongoing regarding a change in lending behavior , following the failures of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank . Furthermore , multiple contacts noted they focused on lending to existing customers and became more prudent in lending to new customers . Real Estate and Construction Homebuilders reported steady sales following an unexpected uptick in the prior period . Contacts continued to attribute the recent improvement to incentives , discounts on older inventory , and new homes built with smaller footprints and lower-cost features . Existing home sales fell slightly from already low levels in most markets – following a moderate decline in the prior period . Contacts noted that the lack of new listings and the continued decline in housing affordability meant the normally busy spring housing market may fail to materialize . Requests for assistance with housing and utility bills fell but continued to dominate the share of 211 requests in New Jersey and Pennsylvania . Almost 32 percent of all requests in the two states were related to housing , while 27 percent of the requests regarded utility bills .

IT and Software Services Contacts in IT and software services said that demand and revenues were mostly stable in recent months . On a year-over-year basis , revenues increased by moderate to large margins for all firms . Those latter growth rates were about on par with those of the previous quarter and exceeded expectations in one case . Furthermore , the growth was attributed to factors that had boosted real demand , such as the transition to subscription-based business models . Capital and technology spending was unchanged , and no future changes were anticipated . Contacts expected demand to hold fairly steady at strong levels in the next quarter . One contact noted that the time required to close deals had increased of late , although the implications for their revenues were not yet clear . Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate activity in the First District increased slightly on balance since February .

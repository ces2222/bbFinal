1,"June 17 , 1970 Summary of Findings Sixth District directors have mixed opinions about future business conditions . If any consensus exists , it is that the economy has not yet bottomed out and that recovery will be less than spectacular when it comes . According to directors ' reports and other sources of information , further weakening in sales , employment and production is likely . Department stores report lower volume and growing resistance to higher priced merchandise . Belt tightening by businesses has spread , and directors report many instances of slowdowns in capital spending . Employment and production cutbacks are common . Retail sales Department stores surveyed report no discernible shift from the `` upstairs '' to the `` bargain basement '' . However , customer resistance to higher priced brands has increased , with lower priced merchandise receiving the benefit . A canvass of merchants by one of our Branch offices indicated that they expect no improvement in sales within the near future . Regarding auto sales , distributors contacted report some shifting from larger cars to the compact sized , loaded with optional equipment . Rather than settling for a stripped-down version of a full-sized car , customers are purchasing lower priced equipment-packed models .

2,"of jewelry manufacturers in southern Massachusetts and northern Rhode Island report that 1970 sales levels to date are brisk . The textile industry , concentrated in the same area , has experienced a dramatic increase in demand for products associated with home sewing , reflecting the heightened consumer cost consciousness noted elsewhere this year . The New England machine tool industry , on the other hand , continues in a severely depressed situation with no letup in sight . Several regional producers of chemical and mineral inputs into housing associated products ( e.g. , paints , carpets , linoleum , etc . ) now discern a turnaround in demand as having occurred four to eight weeks ago . Regional labor markets , as noted in earlier reports , are softer than they have been for some years . This easing apparently extends into both blue- and white-collar groups . The views of our academic consultants have perhaps converged same since earlier in the summer . Professor Paul Samuelson feels certain that the economic turnaround is behind us , and that the slowdown has been sufficiently mild that it will escape official NBER designation as a recession . '' As a weak contraction tends to be followed by a sluggish expansion , Samuelson expressed concern that the existent real GNP gap will widen further over the next four quarters .

Since a growth in real output of about 4 percent is necessary to avoid this , he concludes that authorities should permit a monetary expansion great enough",0.3,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:29:39.5311914Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": 0.3\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 1055, 30717, 16621, 304, 18070, 21393, 323, 18172, 49881, 10720, 1895, 429, 220, 16, 24, 22, 15, 6625, 5866, 311, 2400, 525, 74391, 659, 576, 65538, 4958, 1154, 37526, 304, 279, 1852, 3082, 1154, 702, 10321, 264, 21771, 5263, 304, 7479, 369, 3871, 5815, 448, 2114, 51219, 1154, 41752, 279, 59387, 11502, 2783, 24875, 10342, 17920, 419, 1042, 659, 576, 1532, 9448, 5662, 5392, 4958, 1154, 389, 279, 1008, 1424, 1154, 9539, 304, 264, 34806, 41542, 6534, 448, 902, 1077, 454, 304, 13929, 659, 25694, 15130, 23308, 315, 11483, 323, 24136, 11127, 1119, 11721, 5815, 3871, 320, 384, 1302, 13, 1154, 56848, 1154, 88241, 1154, 9805, 1263, 372, 1154, 4992, 659, 873, 1431, 41545, 264, 66510, 304, 7479, 438, 3432, 10017, 3040, 311, 8063, 5555, 4134, 659, 25294, 9327, 11725, 1154, 438, 10342, 304, 6788, 6682, 1154, 525, 63130, 1091, 807, 614, 1012, 369, 1045, 1635, 659, 1096, 44304, 13812, 2239, 1119, 2176, 6303, 12, 323, 4158, 96836, 5203, 659, 576, 6194, 315, 1039, 14250, 49084, 614, 8365, 96775, 1852, 2474, 6788, 304, 279, 7324, 659, 16642, 6898, 31907, 930, 11074, 3654, 429, 279, 6955, 66510, 374, 4815, 601, 1154, 323, 429, 279, 73917, 702, 1012, 38944, 23034, 429, 432, 686, 12449, 3946, 451, 9552, 42751, 438, 264, 38521, 659, 3355, 1634, 264, 7469, 70795, 27236, 311, 387, 8110, 553, 264, 86946, 14461, 1154, 31907, 930, 13302, 4643, 429, 279, 3000, 306, 1931, 479, 26227, 12929, 686, 93315, 4623, 916, 279, 1790, 3040, 31473, 6762, 12549, 264, 6513, 304, 1931, 2550, 315, 911, 220, 19, 3266, 374, 5871, 311, 5648, 419, 1154, 566, 44437, 429, 11276, 1265, 11549, 264, 32284, 14461, 2244, 3322, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 1, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 18, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3271303200, 'load_duration': 11822000, 'prompt_eval_count': 327, 'prompt_eval_duration': 962288000, 'eval_count': 12, 'eval_duration': 2294040000}"

Price increases for durable goods continue to be about as numerous as in recent months , and there is no clear evidence of a diminution of the rate of rise of prices of finished goods . Rising costs and unsatisfactory volume are causing transportation firms to push regulatory authorities for appreciable increases in rates in hopes of improving earnings .

Life insurance companies would like to improve their liquidity and are not seeking new long-term investment outlets . Loan demand at large commercial banks appears to have eased somewhat , but this is not a universal view . Demand on the capital markets by corporations and municipalities continues to be intense .

6,"July 15 , 1970 Economic activity in the Fourth District improved in June , partly reflecting the termination of major strikes . The results of our most recent survey of manufacturers indicate that a more than usual seasonal decline in business conditions may develop in July in the district , although the bunching of plant-wide shutdowns for vacations at this time of year makes the data unusually difficult to interpret . Our directors remain generally pessimistic about the near-term economic outlook , although some of the industrialists feel that economic conditions may be a little better now than in previous months . In response to our question about price developments , we received a few reports of price discounting , but the consensus of our directors and a limited sample of business economists in the district was that prices will remain firm because of strong upward wage pressures . The improvement in economic conditions in the district in June was largely the result of the resumption of production and shipments following work stoppages in the area . The seasonally adjusted rate of insured unemployment for the district declined in June , and at month-end was approximately halfway between the pre-trucking strike level of March and the peak reached in mid-May . Steel ingot production in the district recovered in June after having declined in April and May .

In comparison with the 1969 holiday season , the majority of retailers reported that they expect a heavier volume of sales this year . Three of the retailers expected a substantially heavier volume , eleven expected a slightly heavier volume , seven expected sales to be about the same as in the 1969 season , while only three felt sales might be slightly lighter this year . In the way of general comments , one retailer noted that consumer sentiment was low due to the economic situation but expected relief during the fourth quarter and early in 1971 . One noted that if the General Motors strike continued , plus the massive layoffs at Texas Instruments , Ling-Temco-Vought , General Dynamics and Ford , that holiday sales could be softer than are now anticipated . One retailer indicated he was taking a `` lean bull '' position and expected October through April to be very strong for retail sales .",0.25,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:29:56.3202945Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.25\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 1921, 291, 36898, 388, 525, 1602, 7853, 315, 3349, 10707, 518, 419, 882, 659, 758, 12313, 448, 279, 220, 16, 24, 21, 24, 13257, 3200, 1154, 279, 8686, 315, 29182, 4961, 429, 807, 1720, 264, 43822, 8123, 315, 6625, 419, 1042, 659, 14513, 315, 279, 29182, 3601, 264, 31202, 43822, 8123, 1154, 44214, 3601, 264, 10078, 43822, 8123, 1154, 8094, 3601, 6625, 311, 387, 911, 279, 1852, 438, 304, 279, 220, 16, 24, 21, 24, 3200, 1154, 1393, 1172, 2326, 6476, 6625, 2578, 387, 10078, 29573, 419, 1042, 659, 758, 279, 1616, 315, 4586, 6042, 1154, 825, 36791, 10342, 429, 11502, 25975, 572, 3347, 4152, 311, 279, 6955, 6534, 714, 3601, 15957, 2337, 279, 11737, 8338, 323, 4124, 304, 220, 16, 24, 22, 16, 659, 3776, 10342, 429, 421, 279, 3251, 36692, 13169, 8570, 1154, 5519, 279, 10951, 98822, 518, 8257, 57413, 1154, 50858, 9285, 336, 1015, 19625, 2450, 1154, 3251, 52611, 323, 14010, 1154, 429, 13257, 6625, 1410, 387, 63130, 1091, 525, 1431, 29099, 659, 3776, 36791, 16317, 566, 572, 4633, 264, 9902, 15651, 16811, 3355, 2309, 323, 3601, 6527, 1526, 5813, 311, 387, 1602, 3746, 369, 10806, 6625, 659, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 17, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3589410400, 'load_duration': 26342000, 'prompt_eval_count': 245, 'prompt_eval_duration': 914260000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 2646477000}"
8,"October 14 , 1970 There is evidence that future growth in large CD 's at Tenth District banks will be less . There are indications also that business loan demand may be easing slightly . The labor situation in the Kansas City area has worsened as the construction strike—now in its seventh month—continues and the General Motors strike prevails at several large GM assembly plants . The reduction in output of feed grains and high feed-grain prices is likely to have an impact on the WPI and CPI within several months . Instead of providing a downward pressure on these indices which occurred from March to August , farm prices may again exert upward pressure later this year or early next year . Those large District banks which have actively sought large CD 's ( many have not ) have continued to attract substantial amounts of funds . Growth rates of outstanding CD 's have been comparable to those at large banks in New York City and Chicago . One peculiarity in the Tenth District has been that a significant amount of CD funds have come from state and local governmental units—about one-third of the total growth in CD 's .

With the recent difficulties in the mid-east , tanker rates have increased by as much as 300 per cent , and imported crude now sells at about 75 cents per barrel above domestic crude on the east coast . Thus , domestic crude prices are under pressure , and at least one oil company has announced price increases in the Tenth District . Business is slow for District farm implement dealers . Inventories are relatively large , and cases of price cutting are not uncommon . Collections on credit sales are reported to be noticeably slower than last year . The interrelatedness of Tenth District economic activity with both national and international business conditions is illustrated by the experience of a Kansas City manufacturer of bottling and automatic vending equipment . This firm 's total business is about unchanged from a year ago , with increasing international business about offsetting a definite decline in domestic sales . The decline in domestic sales is attributed to reduced overtime and lower employment in factories with vending machines , as vending machine operators drop routes and defer the purchase of new equipment . There is some concern within the firm that their growing international business will be hurt by retaliations against U. S. restrictions on imports .

10,"this expectation primarily on the fact that about 40 percent of GM 's production workers are under 25 years old , and these workers tend to be more militant than the older workers . If his expectation is borne out , GM dealers in the District will probably run short of parts and new autos , as inventory shortages are already becoming apparent . The Northwest Airlines strike is also having scattered effects throughout the District . A few firms servicing Northwest Airlines have furloughed employees , and a number of retail establishments have experienced noticeable sales reductions . In addition , Northwest Airlines has cut their flight schedules because of the strike , and as a result landing fees to a number of airports in the District have been drastically reduced . These landing fees are important contributions to airport sinking funds , and in at least one case so far , these reductions have become especially troublesome . Ninth District bankers are still experiencing strong demands for loanable funds , according to information gathered during go-around sessions with both directors and officers of this bank . The continued strong loan demand seems to be general throughout the District as no one cited a case where loan demand had diminished . On the contrary , numerous instances were cited where demand had actually strengthened and non-financial businesses had taken further steps to economize on the use of funds .

One reason frequently cited for the continued strength in loan demand was that inventories seemed to",0.2,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:30:06.9206468Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.2\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 574, 30193, 15503, 389, 279, 2097, 429, 911, 220, 19, 15, 3266, 315, 19172, 364, 82, 5670, 7337, 525, 1212, 220, 17, 20, 1635, 2310, 1154, 323, 1493, 7337, 8376, 311, 387, 803, 51282, 1091, 279, 9014, 7337, 659, 1416, 806, 30193, 374, 64062, 700, 1154, 19172, 26199, 304, 279, 10942, 686, 4658, 1598, 2805, 315, 5479, 323, 501, 46872, 1154, 438, 15444, 66176, 525, 2669, 10454, 9981, 659, 576, 39405, 34130, 13169, 374, 1083, 3432, 36967, 6239, 6814, 279, 10942, 659, 362, 2421, 18809, 64818, 39405, 34130, 614, 282, 1085, 1384, 291, 8256, 1154, 323, 264, 1372, 315, 10806, 62237, 614, 10321, 42326, 6625, 46211, 659, 758, 5256, 1154, 39405, 34130, 702, 3931, 862, 10971, 36769, 1576, 315, 279, 13169, 1154, 323, 438, 264, 1102, 20327, 12436, 311, 264, 1372, 315, 45063, 304, 279, 10942, 614, 1012, 47763, 11046, 659, 4220, 20327, 12436, 525, 2989, 19026, 311, 16733, 61093, 10514, 1154, 323, 304, 518, 3245, 825, 1142, 773, 3041, 1154, 1493, 46211, 614, 3635, 5310, 77418, 659, 85758, 10942, 63143, 525, 2058, 24084, 3746, 18154, 369, 11679, 480, 10514, 1154, 4092, 311, 1995, 20190, 2337, 728, 45616, 15704, 448, 2176, 27354, 323, 9611, 315, 419, 6073, 659, 576, 8570, 3746, 11679, 7479, 4977, 311, 387, 4586, 6814, 279, 10942, 438, 902, 825, 21870, 264, 1142, 1380, 11679, 7479, 1030, 53082, 659, 1913, 279, 25047, 1154, 12114, 13121, 1033, 21870, 1380, 7479, 1030, 3520, 59762, 323, 2477, 83999, 4898, 9675, 1030, 4429, 4623, 7354, 311, 11467, 551, 389, 279, 990, 315, 10514, 6762, 3966, 2874, 13814, 21870, 369, 279, 8570, 8170, 304, 11679, 7479, 572, 429, 17023, 2433, 9324, 311, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 17, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3622816700, 'load_duration': 24721500, 'prompt_eval_count': 324, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1014395000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2580482000}"

As in previous months , '' down grading '' , and `` bargain hunting '' remained in evidence , and higher priced items continued to perform poorly . Industrial production remains weak . Most manufacturers contacted reported no change or some decline as compared with last month in output , sales , and new orders and , in general , look for only a moderate pickup in the coming months . Further slowdowns were evident in the machine tools , electronic , and business equipment industries ( notably in the Boston and Chicago Districts ) and in the aerospace and timber industries ( San Francisco ) , but the weakness also extended to other industries . Some rebound in December was expected in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts , which had been particularly hard hit by the General Motors strike . However , reports from the steel industry in the Cleveland District reveal that the release of steel stockpiled for General Motors has so far been smaller than expected . Moreover , those steel economists that were contacted felt that inventory stockpiling by steel users against the possibility of a strike in the steel industry next year would begin later than during previous strike-hedging periods , with the `` big push '' coming",-0.3,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:30:10.4683295Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.3\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 46592, 8123, 315, 6625, 304, 3460, 9292, 10533, 1033, 1495, 220, 16, 15, 3266, 504, 264, 1042, 4134, 659, 1913, 279, 1008, 1424, 1154, 29182, 304, 1045, 5302, 2293, 77469, 1154, 14630, 1154, 20441, 1154, 36005, 2293, 7201, 369, 264, 5089, 15673, 916, 1537, 1042, 364, 82, 13257, 6625, 659, 1634, 304, 3681, 3951, 1154, 3355, 1495, 65188, 3355, 1154, 323, 9902, 44563, 22514, 3355, 14616, 304, 5904, 1154, 323, 5080, 32605, 3589, 8570, 311, 2736, 30455, 659, 24545, 5670, 8458, 7469, 659, 7496, 16621, 24542, 4961, 902, 2297, 476, 1045, 17704, 438, 7707, 448, 1537, 2254, 304, 2550, 1154, 6625, 1154, 323, 501, 10163, 323, 1154, 304, 4586, 1154, 1401, 369, 1172, 264, 23193, 29586, 304, 279, 5001, 3951, 659, 15533, 73917, 82, 1033, 29476, 304, 279, 5662, 7375, 1154, 14346, 1154, 323, 2562, 7096, 19102, 320, 34046, 304, 279, 10196, 323, 10557, 10942, 82, 873, 323, 304, 279, 77064, 323, 44788, 19102, 320, 5836, 12879, 873, 1154, 714, 279, 23078, 1083, 11577, 311, 1008, 19102, 659, 4329, 41532, 304, 6652, 572, 3601, 304, 279, 23475, 323, 10557, 10942, 82, 1154, 892, 1030, 1012, 7945, 2588, 4201, 553, 279, 3251, 36692, 13169, 659, 4354, 1154, 6682, 504, 279, 9509, 4958, 304, 279, 23475, 10942, 16400, 429, 279, 4879, 315, 9509, 5591, 79, 2181, 369, 3251, 36692, 702, 773, 3041, 1012, 9155, 1091, 3601, 659, 22827, 1154, 1846, 9509, 44315, 429, 1033, 24542, 6476, 429, 15444, 5591, 79, 7979, 553, 9509, 3847, 2348, 279, 13038, 315, 264, 13169, 304, 279, 9509, 4958, 1790, 1042, 1035, 3161, 2937, 1091, 2337, 3681, 13169, 2832, 291, 3173, 18346, 1154, 448, 279, 9902, 2409, 4484, 3355, 5001, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 481, 15, 13, 18, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3541230100, 'load_duration': 15072600, 'prompt_eval_count': 327, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1003752000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2520622000}"

Residential construction is reported to be improved in the St. Louis , Minneapolis , and Kansas City Districts . In the latter case , the improvement follows a prolonged strike in several of the building trades . Residential building continues weak , however , in the Boston , Richmond , Atlanta , and San Francisco Districts . While the liquidity positions of financial institutions are reported to have improved , the consensus of the reports is that loan demand remains weak . In some Districts this is reported to have led to greater investment in municipal securities by banks , and there is some speculation about the possibility of an imminent cut in the prime rate . Some moderation in the growth of prices is mentioned in the Richmond , Chicago , Dallas , and San Francisco reports . In some areas , consumers are continuing to shift to lower-to-medium priced goods , and price shading of consumer items is reported . Concern continues to be voiced , however , about the problem of controlling inflation in view of recent labor settlements which have resulted in large wage increases , for example , in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts . Increases in gas and electric utility rates and in prices of public services are of concern in the Atlanta District .

Most directors and other business leaders were less than enthusiastic over the use of wage and price controls . However , several were relatively open minded toward this approach , while many of the respondents felt additional action on the part of the Administration to limit further wage and price increases was needed . The Chairman of the electrical equipment manufacturer reported that the Business Council , which he headed until recently , had made it clear to President Nixon that Council Members do n't want wage and price controls because they are convinced they will never work . One director , however , commented that the time was approaching when wage and price controls must be adopted , and another director felt that , while controls would not be workable over any extended period , such controls might have a useful psychological effect for a short period . A partner in large investment banking firm noted that incomes policies have failed all over the world where they have been tried , but felt it was up to the United States to seek to find a solution to the problem of full employment without inflation . The directors in general felt that liquidity was still a problem for certain firms . Two upstate bankers stated it was a serious problem for the marginal , smaller companies .

14,"January 12 , 1971 A research department survey of department store executives indicated slight year to year gains in sales in December , continued purchases of less expensive merchandise , and an expectation of sluggish sales . According to newspaper reports , a steady stream of price increases continues and consumer loan rates have not been lowered in East Tennessee or Florida . Surveys conducted by directors of the Nashville Branch indicate adamant opposition to any type of incomes policy . The Jacksonville Branch Directors , on the other hand , expect some version of an incomes policy , with businessmen preferring guidelines to rigid controls . On December 28 , seven department store executives in Atlanta , Jacksonville , Birmingham , New Orleans , and Nashville were surveyed . The highest estimated year-to-year gain in December sales was 4.5 per cent . Most of the respondents reported a 1- to 2-per cent gain , though a store in Birmingham indicated that it experienced a 10 per cent decline . However , this was largely attributed to a construction strike that has now been settled . All respondents indicated that consumers continued to practice `` buying down , '' that is . purchasing less expensive lines of merchandise .

The Atlanta sales picture was mixed , with one respondent reporting sales stronger than expected but the other reporting sales about as expected . The survey detected a noticeable increase in optimism among retailers , and most of the respondents thought that the consumers had `` loosened up '' and begun to spend . There are some notable exceptions to generally more prosperous conditions in the District . The mobile-home industry continues to be in a slump , although some pickup has been reported in recent weeks . Several mobile-home plants are reported to have closed in south Georgia , and one Alabama producer has filed for bankruptcy . Yet , a site has reportedly been purchased for a fourth mobile-home plant near Ocala , Florida .

Until the Phase II program was made public , about one-fourth of the directors were expecting substantial increases in prices , half were anticipating moderate increases , and the rest were looking for little change . Thus , the consensus of directors , by a small majority , is that the creation of the Pay and Price Boards enhances the prospect for greater price stability . The outlook for the regional economy was also largely unchanged by announcement of the Phase II outline . Eighteen of the directors currently foresee a moderate increase in activity in their local areas , as compared with 14 earlier . The announcement caused no alteration in the directors ' assessment of the prospects for the unemployment rate in their local areas . Just over half were ( and still are ) anticipating a moderate decline in the unemployment rate . The directors believe that prices will edge upward slightly in the district . Earlier , directors were somewhat less optimistic about prices . Commercial banking directors were also surveyed on their outlook for money and capital market rates and the commercial bank prime lending rate . Nine of the 14 commercial bankers now believe that short-term rates will decline moderately .

Preliminary estimates indicate that the seasonally adjusted Texas industrial production index fell slightly in July , with all sectors sharing in the drop except utilities , which remained unchanged .

21,"adversely affected by curtailment of Government uranium purchases . Since retail sales are so important at this time of year and consumer spending is being closely watched as a clue to economic growth in 1971 , district retail stores were again surveyed this month . Reports were mixed—with some department stores and discount houses reporting a decline in sales during December , as compared with the same month last year ; while others reported gains , mostly of a modest nature . After having generally good sales in November , several stores reported that sales in early December were disappointing but then improved substantially again just before Christmas . Weather conditions may have been partly responsible for this pattern . Generally , stores that had the best gains were the large combination mail order-department stores . One regional controller of a chain of such stores said that their sales usually hold up quite well during economic slowdowns when customers are interested in good quality at reasonable prices . Somewhat surprisingly , a large store that specializes in luxury gift items and caters to above-average income customers reported sales this fall increased by about 10 per cent . Generally , stores that had strong sales just before Christmas also report strong post-Christmas sales , while stores with weak pre-Christmas sales continue to exhibit weak sales .

The surveyed retail stores were also asked whether they had used any extra promotional activities such as intensified advertising campaigns or earlier price reductions this year due to the economic slowdown",0.25,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:30:45.192976Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.25\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 329, 3004, 974, 11495, 553, 2847, 14586, 478, 315, 10212, 53844, 23491, 659, 8704, 10806, 6625, 525, 773, 2989, 518, 419, 882, 315, 1042, 323, 11502, 10164, 374, 1660, 15148, 15384, 438, 264, 29989, 311, 6955, 6513, 304, 220, 16, 24, 22, 16, 1154, 9290, 10806, 10533, 1033, 1549, 47998, 419, 2254, 659, 28040, 1033, 9519, 80802, 1045, 9292, 10533, 323, 11089, 14967, 12827, 264, 17704, 304, 6625, 2337, 6652, 1154, 438, 7707, 448, 279, 1852, 2254, 1537, 1042, 2587, 1393, 3800, 4961, 19619, 1154, 10008, 315, 264, 26848, 6993, 659, 4636, 3432, 8789, 1661, 6625, 304, 6702, 1154, 3807, 10533, 4961, 429, 6625, 304, 4124, 6652, 1033, 38123, 714, 1221, 12944, 31202, 1549, 1101, 1573, 10074, 659, 22629, 4682, 1231, 614, 1012, 27037, 8480, 369, 419, 5383, 659, 43393, 1154, 10533, 429, 1030, 279, 1850, 19619, 1033, 279, 3460, 10601, 8072, 1973, 6810, 35991, 10533, 659, 3776, 15130, 6461, 315, 264, 8781, 315, 1741, 10533, 1053, 429, 862, 6625, 5990, 3331, 705, 5008, 1632, 2337, 6955, 73917, 82, 979, 6310, 525, 8014, 304, 1661, 4271, 518, 13276, 7576, 659, 17564, 80475, 28292, 1154, 264, 3460, 3553, 429, 45572, 304, 19352, 8189, 3589, 323, 8251, 388, 311, 3403, 77426, 7911, 6310, 4961, 6625, 419, 4399, 7172, 553, 911, 220, 16, 15, 817, 2889, 659, 43393, 1154, 10533, 429, 1030, 3746, 6625, 1101, 1573, 10074, 1083, 1895, 3746, 1736, 12, 58603, 6625, 1154, 1393, 10533, 448, 7469, 855, 12, 58603, 6625, 3060, 311, 30224, 7469, 6625, 6762, 785, 47998, 10806, 10533, 1033, 1083, 4588, 3425, 807, 1030, 1483, 894, 4960, 34282, 7488, 1741, 438, 78749, 12876, 20686, 476, 6788, 3349, 46211, 419, 1042, 4152, 311, 279, 6955, 73917, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 17, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3808763800, 'load_duration': 14590900, 'prompt_eval_count': 331, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1015978000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 2776192000}"

Except for some increase in farm machinery sales , prospects of a 7 per cent tax credit have not yet affected District investment spending . According to reports received from Bank directors , uncertainty over Phase II has not affected the pace of economic activity in the Ninth District . One director stated that businessmen in his area were going ahead with their plans despite any uncertainty over Phase II . Another director considered Phase II a topic of conversation , but felt that it has not altered business decisions . One report , however , indicated that small businesses had held down , or delayed , raises due to difficulty in interpreting Phase II guidelines . The only adverse impact of Phase II reported by another director was that the time spent by businessmen in interpreting Phase II rules had kept managers away from more productive endeavors .

23,"was in existing housing and new construction had not yet begun to improve . In contrast to the generally weak business loan demand in other parts of the country , the demand for business loans in the ninth district appears to be quite strong . Conversations with three reserve city bankers revealed that the rise in their business loans is stronger than they had anticipated , and some of these people felt that the recent cuts in the prime rate were unjustified , at least for their banks . One Director , who is also the president of a reserve city bank , said that although he keeps expecting his bank 's outstanding loan balances to fall , they keep rising to new highs . He feels that a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that his national customers have tended to ignore the corporate bond market as a source of debt funds and instead are relying on banks for their borrowings . Three other Directors from rural areas in the district also felt that loan demand was picking up . Although they were not sure of the reasons for the strengthening , they were able to cite instances pointing to a rise in loan demand . One South Dakota Director said , for example , that a number of banks in his area had dropped out of participation pools because they were able to use all their loanable funds for local borrowers .

25,"in the former case , the increase is a recovery from the strike- induced slump . The lack of strong demand is reflected in automobile production . General Motors has reduced overtime schedules and the other automobile producers are operating at reduced levels . Manufacturing shows no sign of a general recovery . There are industries which report a rise in output ( containers , furniture , steel , some machine tools , and textiles ) , but other industries are still retrenching . Although major layoffs of workers are occurring less often , companies are continuing to reduce their workforces through attrition or unpaid holidays . Increased hiring is still not widespread . Investment plans similarly are restrained and expenditures on capital equipment in 1971 are expected to be at about the same level as last year . Even rising new orders for steel are not a reflection of an upturn in the economy but rather represent hedging against either a steel strike or further price rises . According to steel industry economists , overall production for this year will not be above last year . There is one sector which has favorable prospects for recovery . The demand for residential housing is picking up and sales of existing houses are increasing . Nonresidential construction is not as strong at the moment , and in many areas it is quite weak . But the net effect is to increase demand for the output of the building- materials industries and timber .

26,"higher sales volume is extending into the new year . The sales gains were predominantly in the lower priced items . Higher priced items such as color TV sets and high quality clothing continue to move slowly . Retailers report that inventories of most goods remain at very conservative levels , indicating considerable doubt that the recent upturn in sales will continue . Manufacturers are cautiously optimistic compared with the fact that no change was foreseen a month ago . The Cleveland Bank reports that new steel orders have increased sharply since mid-December . Furthermore , steel industry economists expect a big pickup in steel shipments to begin about March and the second quarter to be much stronger than the first . Much of this anticipated gain is based on rising demand in preparation for a steel strike . The Richmond Bank reported an increase in manufacturers ' inventories . With the exception of the steel companies , however , manufacturers generally do not indicate great gains in sales expectations . In conformity with this view , some layoffs and plant closings have recently occurred in the electronics and TV industries . Most Reserve banks indicate that the current high rate of unemployment is likely to continue for several months . Further declines in employment , however , are not expected as most reports indicate that the retrenchment process of firms is about complete .

Any future increases in the unemployment rate will primarily reflect additions to the labor force rather than layoffs .

28,"August 18 , 1971 The pessimism regarding the economic outlook that had been expressed by the directors of the New York Bank and of the Buffalo Branch last month was still evident , and perhaps intensified , this month ( before the Administration announced its new measures ) . In general , the assessment was for no significant change in consumer attitudes , while some directors believed there had been an actual scaling back of buying intentions ; business inventory spending was not expected to strengthen in the near future ; no noticeable improvement in labor market conditions was foreseen and most of the directors felt that a general economic upturn would gain momentum later than had been generally expected . Concerning consumer spending , the Buffalo Branch directors viewed retail sales activity as relatively better than a year ago , but with no discernible trend either up or down . The New York Branch directors were somewhat more pessimistic . A director from Rochester had had recent discussions with a cross section of New York City department store executives , who reported a slowdown in consumer spending in recent weeks and were generally pessimistic regarding the immediate future . The chairman of the board of a nationwide manufacturing concern believed that consumers were exhibiting caution and more selectivity regarding both price and quality , and saw consumer reluctance showing up particularly in discretionary spending , such as that for travel .

29,"July 21 , 1971 The opinions expressed recently by Second District Federal Reserve Bank directors seemed to reflect some renewed doubts regarding the strength of the economic recovery . The directors in general foresaw no near-term improvement in the unemployment picture—indeed a few expected further weakening—and some felt that additional disruptive strikes were in the offing . On the other hand , the outlook for consumer spending and residential construction remains good ; no significant changes in the trends in these sectors were thought to have occurred in the recent past . Most of the directors felt that a widespread lack of confidence among both businessmen and consumers is a major factor in the disappointingly slow rate of economic recovery . Concerning the unemployment situation , the directors felt the continuing efforts of businessmen to cut back costs made it unlikely that a significant reduction of unemployment would be achieved in the coming months . The chairman of the board of a large New York City bank said he expected that his firm would have a smaller staff at the end of 1971 than it had earlier in the year , and felt that other financial institutions-the city 's strongest employers—also would not contribute much support for the local job market this year . The president of a nationwide manufacturer of plumbing and related products felt that the wage-cost squeeze was forcing industry to cut back on spending and employment .

37,"indicators of retail spending were mixed . Registrations of new passenger automobiles fell 7 percent from the month before in Dallas , Fort Worth , Houston , and San Antonio . But cumulative registrations in the four centers for the year were 20 percent greater than in 1970 . Department store sales in the Eleventh District were 11 percent higher in the four weeks ended January 22 than in the corresponding period a year before . Total sales for 1971 were 7 percent higher than in 1970 . The cotton harvest in Texas and Oklahoma , which was the latest in 20 years , is nearing completion . The cotton harvest in Arizona , Louisiana , and New Mexico is also virtually finished . The cotton crop in the District states is expected to total slightly less than 4.3 million bales . That is well below the 4.6 million bale crop in 1970 . Higher prevailing prices for all quantities of cotton are partially offsetting the production losses which were attributable to unseasonably cold and wet weather . Livestock conditions are generally good in the District . On January 1 , Texas had 20 percent more cattle on feed than a year earlier , but the number on feed in Arizona declined slightly during the same period . The index of livestock and livestock products rose substantially from mid-November through mid-January as beef cattle and hog prices were up sharply .",0.25,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:31:41.24177Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": 0.25\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 484, 42052, 315, 10806, 10164, 1033, 9519, 659, 74559, 804, 315, 501, 23148, 78548, 11052, 220, 22, 3266, 504, 279, 2254, 1573, 304, 18542, 1154, 11002, 36146, 1154, 16003, 1154, 323, 5836, 22437, 659, 1988, 39844, 69490, 304, 279, 3040, 18652, 369, 279, 1042, 1033, 220, 17, 15, 3266, 7046, 1091, 304, 220, 16, 24, 22, 15, 659, 5887, 3553, 6625, 304, 279, 25949, 44607, 10942, 1033, 220, 16, 16, 3266, 5080, 304, 279, 3040, 5555, 9482, 6058, 220, 17, 17, 1091, 304, 279, 12159, 4168, 264, 1042, 1573, 659, 10657, 6625, 369, 220, 16, 24, 22, 16, 1033, 220, 22, 3266, 5080, 1091, 304, 220, 16, 24, 22, 15, 659, 576, 23522, 23429, 304, 8257, 323, 22797, 1154, 892, 572, 279, 5535, 304, 220, 17, 15, 1635, 1154, 374, 82299, 9755, 659, 576, 23522, 23429, 304, 16938, 1154, 28874, 1154, 323, 1532, 12270, 374, 1083, 21214, 8060, 659, 576, 23522, 19097, 304, 279, 10942, 5302, 374, 3601, 311, 2790, 10078, 2686, 1091, 220, 19, 13, 18, 3526, 293, 3831, 659, 2938, 374, 1632, 3685, 279, 220, 19, 13, 21, 3526, 293, 1574, 19097, 304, 220, 16, 24, 22, 15, 659, 34221, 60029, 7576, 369, 678, 32676, 315, 23522, 525, 25244, 4347, 1280, 279, 5670, 17683, 892, 1033, 70426, 311, 650, 16798, 2845, 9255, 323, 14401, 9104, 659, 36211, 477, 1176, 4682, 525, 8789, 1661, 304, 279, 10942, 659, 1913, 6058, 220, 16, 1154, 8257, 1030, 220, 17, 15, 3266, 803, 35852, 389, 5395, 1091, 264, 1042, 6788, 1154, 714, 279, 1372, 389, 5395, 304, 16938, 18758, 10078, 2337, 279, 1852, 4168, 659, 576, 1922, 315, 50776, 323, 50776, 3871, 16009, 31202, 504, 5099, 70488, 1377, 1526, 5099, 66452, 3536, 438, 24317, 35852, 323, 45925, 7576, 1033, 705, 45373, 659, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 1, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 17, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3585322100, 'load_duration': 27023200, 'prompt_eval_count': 344, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1065091000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2483202000}"
38,"October 11 , 1972 Indicators of economic activity in the Eleventh District were mixed in August . Although the Texas Industrial Production Index eased slightly from its revised record level in July , the unemployment rate for the five District states declined , and employment continued to increase . Department store sales in the District also continued strong , and construction activity rebounded sharply . However , the rate of new car registrations declined slightly . A decrease in the production of nonmanufactured goods was primarily responsible for the slight decline in the seasonally adjusted Texas Industrial Production Index in August . The decline was centered in public utilities and crude oil mining . Nevertheless , production in both these industries was well above its level of a year ago . The Index for manufacturing industries remained essentially unchanged . Seasonally adjusted total nonagricultural employment in the five Southwestern states rose to a record level in August and helped to push the unemployment rate down slightly . Both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing employment increased , with employment in durable goods manufacturing and mining showing particularly notable gains . Government employment and employment in service industries also increased in August . Slight employment declines were reported in construction and transportation and public utilities . However , all industry groups posted year-to-year gains .

Total construction contracts awarded in the five Southwestern states were up sharply in August .

39,"February 9 , 1972 Phase II policies , and competitive market forces operating in an economy performing well below its potential , are apparently combining to moderate the pace of rising prices . A survey of purchasing agents and managers in the Tenth District indicates that they perceive ( 1 ) a somewhat slower rate of price rise for materials they purchase , ( 2 ) generally good compliance by vendors with Phase II guidelines , and ( 3 ) the existence of market forces also acting to restrain price increases . Inventory policy is quite conservative , with little buildup of stocks now anticipated , almost regardless of industry . Among District banks , consumer installment lending and agricultural loan demand remain strong , while local business loan demand has shown little change in recent weeks from its basically weak position . The view from the desks of purchasing managers in the Tenth District seems to be favorable to Phase II , with overall understanding and compliance felt to be generally good . Specific comments suggest that , as far as purchasing agents are concerned , vendors generally appear to be following the Phase II guidelines . Purchasing agents for a number of firms regularly review suppliers ' prices for compliance , some require invoices to be stamped as in accordance with Price Commission rulings , and others report that notices of price rises are accompanied with word that they have been cleared with the Price Commission .

40,"August 9 , 1972 The vigor in the economic recovery reflected nationally in the most recent GNP figures appears to be mirrored in the sales reports of a number of Tenth District manufacturing firms as well as in comments elicited from bank directors . Increased sales were reported quite generally , and although little evidence of stockpiling is evident , inventory spending is keeping pace with recent sales improvements . Some firms reported longer delivery times to their customers , and there were scattered reports of lengthening lead times for inventory purchases from their suppliers . Despite sales increases , however , few of the firms contacted have added net to their work forces , and , as a consequence , there were a number of firms which reported noticeable productivity gains . Tenth District farm income rose more sharply than for the nation as a whole in the first six months of 1972 , and income prospects for all of 1972 appear to be quite strong vis-a-vis last year . Strong loan demand continues at Tenth District banks , and , with few exceptions , District banks have experienced large increases in total deposits . A near-consensus emerged as to improved business sales among those manufacturing firms and directors queried . Comments such as `` best year on record , '' `` up substantially , '' and , `` business sales are beyond targets , '' characterized the kinds of responses received .

Similarly , the vice-president of a large nationwide chain of department stores reported a strengthening in consumer demand at his firm 's stores in the recent past and , notwithstanding the rather slow start earlier this year , looked for a significantly better retail sales performance in 1972 as compared to 1971-both for his firm and the retail trade industry in general . Finally , an official of a medium-price retail store chain , which has experienced a gradual increase in business since last fall , stated that he expects this trend to continue and noted that in the past month there had been a significant increase in his firm 's sale of big-ticket items such as furniture and home appliances .

The directors , with some exceptions , felt the current demand for commercial and industrial bank loans was not particularly strong .

Most bankers expect that prime-rate increases will go along with this increase in loan activity , but they doubt that rate increases will dampen the underlying buoyant demand for credit .",0.85,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:32:09.8048968Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.85\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 4580, 25591, 17023, 2433, 6814, 279, 14919, 1737, 13107, 8781, 1154, 323, 369, 71092, 6008, 7096, 14461, 6649, 429, 1030, 1012, 17113, 15663, 2337, 279, 38521, 659, 4329, 3460, 18809, 1977, 429, 807, 614, 537, 45564, 2805, 9663, 323, 429, 807, 653, 537, 29630, 311, 653, 773, 369, 279, 26313, 315, 279, 1042, 1154, 714, 1493, 18809, 1154, 553, 323, 3460, 1154, 525, 19585, 311, 279, 4586, 9149, 659, 758, 279, 39405, 1154, 25836, 19097, 26851, 614, 6069, 20336, 311, 17193, 369, 7096, 13723, 323, 14461, 659, 758, 279, 18634, 4180, 1154, 264, 3746, 2562, 14461, 702, 3465, 6668, 18154, 369, 28542, 3852, 2010, 1154, 14919, 10779, 1154, 11919, 18652, 1154, 323, 21788, 10604, 10415, 659, 758, 16244, 7043, 1154, 4623, 2562, 26480, 276, 14461, 374, 3601, 1576, 315, 15444, 9162, 323, 279, 11048, 6513, 315, 6722, 10164, 659, 7496, 63143, 1720, 429, 10250, 43026, 12703, 686, 728, 3156, 448, 419, 5263, 304, 11679, 5702, 1154, 714, 807, 10492, 429, 4379, 12703, 686, 40269, 268, 279, 16533, 74620, 517, 7479, 369, 6668, 659, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 23, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3593862400, 'load_duration': 28742300, 'prompt_eval_count': 227, 'prompt_eval_duration': 869842000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 2692873000}"

Despite the satisfactory level of sales and a feeling of optimism by retailers about future sales prospects , there is no sign of any major rebuilding of inventory . Retailers , both small and large , are still operating with inventories at a minimum level . They are still trying to keep inventories down , and , if anything , many are attempting to find ways to reduce them further . Optimism about sales is combined with caution about inventories . Other factors are helping retailers operate with lower inventories . A major reason , according to several directors , is that suppliers are quick to fill orders , thereby reducing the need for inventories . Appliance dealers in the Los Angeles area are described as relying on the close proximity to suppliers to cut down their inventories . Finally , retailers foresee no shortages developing that would require a change in their current policy . A good year is expected for District agriculture .

48,"wage increases for fear of bringing back Phase One-type controls . Professors Eckstein , Samuelson , and Shapiro were available for comment this month . All felt the major problem for the economy is to get Phase Three `` off the ground '' . Shapiro criticized the strange and contradictory statements about Phase Three which have been made by members of the Administration . He urges greater clarification . He cited the relatively flat yield curve as evidence that `` people with money do not have inflationary expectations '' . Due to a lot of bad luck ( weather conditions and blight ) and high income elasticity of the demand for meat , Samuelson doubts prices can be held to the stated goals . Specifically , the 5.5 percent wage standard is not possible to achieve , given the recent and likely future path of the cost of living . On the other hand , cost-push inflation is not something that the monetary authorities can or ought to do a lot about , according to Samuelson . Samuelson also felt it inadvisable to be committed to a dollar parity rate at the cost of tighter interest rates than would be justified on the grounds of domestic policy . While Shapiro would have preferred to have let the dollar float , he urged the United States to stand firm in not supporting the dollar , forcing other countries to take either goods or dollars .

A `` shakeout '' of weaker competitors in the motor home and other recreational fields is said to be near-at-hand . Such a shakeout has been in progress for the past year in modular home building , and plant shutdowns are still reported . The mortgage market has eased with rates in the Detroit area reduced from 9 to 8.5 percent in the past few weeks . The 8 percent usury ceiling in Illinois continues to limit new loans . Home sales in the Chicago area were off about 50 percent from last year in recent weeks . Nevertheless , a recent survey shows prices of existing homes in the Chicago area to average 10 percent above a year earlier , compared to an 8 percent rise in the previous 12 months . This Bank 's survey of farmland values shows an average increase of 17 percent from a year ago as of October 1 , and a rise of 8 percent in the third quarter . These are the largest increases in the 20 years of the survey . The soybean and corn harvests are coming along very well . Most areas report lower grain moisture content ( and better quality ) than last year , so less fuel will be needed for drying .

Those associated with capital goods and consumer goods areas mentioned that business has been extremely good , both they and their customers are having difficulty in building inventories . Several of the directors reported that they plan to keep a tight rein on their inventory situation , however . Some of the directors were of the opinion that part of the strength in new orders was the result of numerous capital goods customers placing advance orders because they fear shortages later this year . Concern was also expressed about the effect of recent price behavior on the large number of major labor negotiations scheduled through 1973 . Some of the directors are also becoming concerned about the prospects for a reduced pace of business activity in 1974 . One director whose diversified firm has record orders in all areas of its business , mentioned specifically that he expects a drop off in business next year and is therefore avoiding an overextension of plant capacity . Economists from major firms in the area are also reporting ebullient business conditions , and they are projecting a sustained high level of operations—at or near capacity—through 1973 .

One economist with a large machine tool firm in Cleveland said that orders have risen more sharply since September than for any comparable period in the twenty-five years",0.85,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:32:30.8534204Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": 0.85\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 13890, 287, 5080, 7576, 304, 7400, 1091, 304, 6058, 1154, 279, 8426, 7071, 2474, 6156, 220, 16, 24, 20, 21, 659, 873, 17681, 315, 1039, 12785, 27354, 45628, 279, 8170, 315, 501, 10163, 323, 1182, 22081, 304, 862, 18809, 659, 12969, 5815, 448, 6722, 11561, 323, 11502, 11561, 5671, 9733, 429, 2562, 702, 1012, 9016, 1661, 1154, 2176, 807, 323, 862, 6310, 525, 3432, 16829, 304, 4752, 17023, 2433, 659, 25694, 315, 279, 27354, 4961, 429, 807, 3119, 311, 2506, 264, 10296, 15244, 389, 862, 15444, 6534, 1154, 4764, 659, 4329, 315, 279, 27354, 1033, 315, 279, 9459, 429, 949, 315, 279, 8170, 304, 501, 10163, 572, 279, 1102, 315, 12114, 6722, 11561, 6310, 24047, 11912, 10163, 1576, 807, 8679, 66176, 2937, 419, 1042, 659, 51247, 572, 1083, 13302, 911, 279, 2456, 315, 3213, 3349, 7709, 389, 279, 3460, 1372, 315, 3598, 9327, 23449, 13537, 1526, 220, 16, 24, 22, 18, 659, 4329, 315, 279, 27354, 525, 1083, 10454, 11658, 911, 279, 26851, 369, 264, 11046, 17857, 315, 2562, 5702, 304, 220, 16, 24, 22, 19, 659, 3776, 7538, 6693, 84857, 7474, 702, 3255, 10163, 304, 678, 5671, 315, 1181, 2562, 1154, 9733, 11689, 429, 566, 24297, 264, 5943, 1007, 304, 2562, 1790, 1042, 323, 374, 8916, 30426, 458, 916, 12427, 315, 6008, 8654, 659, 50083, 1671, 504, 3598, 18809, 304, 279, 3082, 525, 1083, 12827, 24463, 617, 1167, 2562, 4682, 1154, 323, 807, 525, 81282, 264, 28659, 1550, 2188, 315, 7525, 98463, 476, 3143, 8654, 2293, 19742, 220, 16, 24, 22, 18, 6762, 3966, 45115, 448, 264, 3460, 5662, 5392, 7474, 304, 23475, 1053, 429, 10163, 614, 40382, 803, 45373, 2474, 6122, 1091, 369, 894, 29039, 4168, 304, 279, 17073, 35299, 1635, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 1, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 23, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3607285100, 'load_duration': 13710200, 'prompt_eval_count': 337, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1002283000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2588886000}"

53,"November 14 , 1973 Business activity in the District remains strong , although there are some signs of slowing . Apart from the weakening in housing and consumer durables , the slowing is probably more a reflection of capacity limitations and a tight supply situation in raw materials and fuels than the result of a decline in underlying demand . Our Directors and businessmen and economists in the District are gravely concerned over the energy situation and its implications for the economy in 1974 . Output in the District 's manufacturing sector continues to rise , but signs of slowing in the upward momentum are accumulating . Our monthly survey of manufacturers shows a significant decline in the proportion of firms reporting gains in new orders and backlogs in recent months . September was the poorest month of the year , and early returns for October suggest further weakening occurred . There has also been some slowdown in the rate of inventory accumulation . Delivery time , however , continues to lengthen , compounding the problem of shortages faced by virtually every firm . ( The October report of Cleveland purchasing agents questioned how there could be a recession next year in view of the fact that very little inventory is available and deliveries are taking three to six months or more on practically everything . ) There was a surge in price increases during October , as the largest proportion of firms in the ten-year history of our survey reported paying higher prices .

The majority anticipate little change in long-term rates , although some expect a moderate increase in these rates . None expect either category of rates to be lower . Almost none of the respondents anticipate that the prime lending rate will rise above 7 percent at either midyear or the year-end . In reply to questions relating to their particular banks , our directors indicated that business , consumer , and mortgage loan demand strengthened moderately during the last three months . Only agricultural loan demand remained essentially unchanged . Most respondents did not essentially change their willingness to make mortgage and agricultural loans during the last three months . A few were even more moderately willing to make consumer and business loans . Taking into account their expectations for loan demand , our directors generally rated funds either very available or moderately available at their banks . Slightly more than half are aggressively seeking large certificates of deposit ( CDs ) . While the majority were paying less than 6 percent for 30- to 89-day large CDs , most were paying between 6 and 7 percent for CDs with maturities beyond 89 days . The Directors split half and half as to whether they expect disintermediation of savings and time deposits in the coming six months .

Weaknesses are most apparent in residential housing and automobile sales . The impact of petroleum shortages varies considerably from region to region , and from industry to industry . The prospective gasoline shortages are one cause of reduced demand for regular-size domestic automobiles which has resulted in layoffs in several Districts ( Atlanta , Chicago , Kansas City and San Francisco ) . Sales of compact cars are excellent , and so , interestingly enough , are sales of luxury cars . Diesel fuel , in particular , appears to be in short supply and black markets for this fuel are reported to be developing in some areas . Other industries affected include petrochemical-based plastics , manufacturers of recreational vehicles , and plywood mills .

Shortages of petroleum products , wood products and nonferrous metals were cited by New York , while gasoline rationing was noted in parts of the Atlanta and Dallas districts .

Senior officials of thrift institutions reported that as a result of a net outflow of deposits , together with a sizable backlog of unclosed loan commitments , little or no funds were available for new mortgages in the 1- to 4-family home sector .

70,"February 13 , 1974 Generalizations of the current economic situation in the Seventh District have never been so difficult since the Red Book was launched almost four years ago . The growing ramifications of the energy crisis , continued rapid price inflation in the face of cutbacks in output and employment , widespread shortages , and dissatisfaction with government at all levels have created an unprecedented atmosphere of uncertainty among consumers and businessmen . This mood has been deepened by the independent truckers ' strike which began at the end of January and is not yet fully resolved . Communities dependent on the manufacture of full-sized cars and recreational vehicles are economic disaster areas . In contrast , equipment producers generally are experiencing an unparalleled boom , with many firms unable to meet production schedules . While shortages of materials and components seem worse than ever , there are reports of firms doing precautionary advance buying ( hoarding ) of fuel and supplies of other scarce materials . Most businessmen , apparently , would favor the complete abandonment of price and wage controls . Although the independent truckers ' strike may be ending , the stoppages could be resumed at any time . Consumers and businessmen have an added incentive to add to inventories of required supplies . The strikes have curtailed output and caused layoffs principally in steel , motor vehicles , and meat and poultry processing .

Many operations have been conducted `` off-the-tailgate '' of trucks even before the strike because of short",-0.75,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:33:37.522573Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.75\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 32777, 220, 16, 18, 1154, 220, 16, 24, 22, 19, 3251, 8040, 315, 279, 1482, 6955, 6534, 304, 279, 74625, 10942, 614, 2581, 1012, 773, 5000, 2474, 279, 3731, 5893, 572, 11626, 4558, 3040, 1635, 4134, 659, 576, 7826, 84350, 315, 279, 4802, 11251, 1154, 8570, 11048, 3349, 24527, 304, 279, 3579, 315, 3931, 24113, 304, 2550, 323, 14402, 1154, 23782, 66176, 1154, 323, 96794, 448, 3033, 518, 678, 5866, 614, 3465, 458, 29969, 16566, 315, 26826, 4221, 13417, 323, 82550, 659, 1096, 19671, 702, 1012, 5538, 6758, 553, 279, 9489, 10855, 388, 364, 13169, 892, 6009, 518, 279, 835, 315, 6058, 323, 374, 537, 3602, 7225, 19673, 659, 57343, 17749, 389, 279, 29747, 315, 2480, 27835, 9331, 323, 36000, 11474, 525, 6955, 20763, 5671, 659, 758, 12872, 1154, 7096, 23308, 8789, 525, 24084, 458, 70157, 29745, 1154, 448, 1657, 18809, 11889, 311, 3367, 5670, 36769, 659, 5976, 66176, 315, 7236, 323, 6813, 2803, 10960, 1091, 3512, 1154, 1052, 525, 6682, 315, 18809, 3730, 71047, 658, 11912, 11833, 320, 11386, 28410, 873, 315, 10416, 323, 16720, 315, 1008, 58190, 7236, 659, 7496, 82550, 1154, 13812, 1154, 1035, 4694, 279, 4583, 90302, 315, 3349, 323, 19062, 11574, 659, 10328, 279, 9489, 10855, 388, 364, 13169, 1231, 387, 13391, 1154, 279, 2936, 10781, 1410, 387, 57405, 518, 894, 882, 659, 81991, 323, 82550, 614, 458, 3694, 35110, 311, 912, 311, 17023, 2433, 315, 2567, 16720, 659, 576, 22368, 614, 2847, 2565, 2181, 2550, 323, 8881, 98822, 91281, 304, 9509, 1154, 8872, 11474, 1154, 323, 13041, 323, 65528, 8692, 6762, 8441, 7525, 614, 1012, 13075, 9902, 1007, 10603, 2385, 604, 24601, 3355, 315, 26763, 1496, 1573, 279, 13169, 1576, 315, 2805, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 481, 15, 13, 22, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3740714400, 'load_duration': 13025000, 'prompt_eval_count': 332, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1002906000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 2722096000}"

Since late January , the Chicago area has witnessed long lines of cars at filling stations . Many stations have been closed and others have sharply reduced their hours of operation . Most smaller centers of the District , however , are reported to have plenty of gasoline . ( One reason suggested for the disparity is that Chicago area motorists are taking fewer trips out of town . ) Gas shortages have substantially reduced receipts at many restaurants and other establishments dependent on auto traffic . Insurance salesmen , and other businessmen dependent on mobility , also have been hurt . Perhaps those affected by fuel shortages can take comfort in the recent words of the District 's best know economist : `` I do n't believe the energy problem changes the economic outlook very much . '' In contrast to the gasoline and diesel fuel situations , heating oil problems seem to have faded away—even in Michigan where the problem had appeared most serious . Reductions in output of autos doubtless have released fuel for other uses . Some major District gas utilities have been telling interruptible customers to plan on switching to electricity or to other fuels . They see no possibility of substantially increasing gas supplies in the next several years .

The residential construction situation is miserable , In June , building permits for new dwelling units were off 70 percent from last year and the six months ' total was off over 50 percent . Permits for homes in the Chicago area were lowest for any June since World War II , and permits for apartments were the lowest since 1956 . ( Permits in the Milwaukee area were off over 40 percent for six months . ) The Illinois usury rate was belatedly raised from 8 percent to 9.5 percent in July , but this is not expected to help much because of the impact of high money market rates on the availability of mortgages . Proposed new developments of both residential and commercial projects are said to have `` dried up '' . Financial stringencies reflect the problems of real estate subsidiaries of insurance companies , banks , and manufacturers in obtaining funds , as well as the plight of the savings and loan associations .

74,"The firm does not plan to expand capacity , however , because they fear that the orders may be canceled . The same director noted that many businessmen are expecting wage-price controls and therefore are retrenching on their capital spending . Another director with a utility expressed deep concern that `` utilities are in a liquidity crisis , which may provoke an energy crisis . '' According to this director , electric utilities are canceling atomic plants because of their high capital costs , and substituting less capital intensive coal and oil plants . The irony is that atomic plants have fixed fuel costs , while coal and oil plants have rising fuel costs—so the shift away from atomic plants is inflationary in the long run . A second director confirmed this , noting that both atomic and fossil plants have been canceled because of the high cost of financing and load demand running below expectations . A number of these facilities were slated for completion after 1980 . In addition , because of rising construction costs , there is a rush to complete those plants currently under construction . A Federal Home Loan Bank official reported that , on the basis of the preliminary sample of 35 reporting associations , savings flows in August deteriorated further , especially in the second ten days of the month .

76,"January 16 , 1974 Scarcity of pipe , rigs , and work crews continues to constrain petroleum drilling in the Southwest , according to an association of drillers , since many do not have permanent workers or established lines of supply . The association reports that the shortage of drilling rigs could be a problem for as long as three years because capacity constraints are limiting the ability of manufacturers to fill a growing backlog of orders . The seasonally adjusted index of industrial production in Texas fell in November for the first time since July 1973 . The decline was centered in mining of crude oil , petroleum refining , and production of petroleum-related chemicals . Despite intensified drilling , mining of crude oil has decreased because of the reduction of domestic reserves of crude . At the same time , shortages of crude oil have contributed to the reduction in refining activity , although in recent weeks imports have been greater than they were earlier anticipated to be . Unscheduled shutdowns for repairs and maintenance have also hampered refining . A survey of manufacturers based in Texas indicates that many firms are taking action to stockpile petroleum or petroleum-related products . While many businesses complained about more limited supplies and rising prices , there is no evidence that petroleum or related products are unobtainable .

Shortages were reported in plastics , solvents , and diesel fuel , but many manufacturers seemed just as concerned about the scarcity of nonpetroleum materials such as steel ,",-0.5,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:33:57.655619Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.5\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 32227, 220, 16, 21, 1154, 220, 16, 24, 22, 19, 2463, 8198, 487, 315, 13647, 1154, 95051, 1154, 323, 975, 42060, 9539, 311, 79699, 58963, 38562, 304, 279, 45685, 1154, 4092, 311, 458, 15010, 315, 30546, 388, 1154, 2474, 1657, 653, 537, 614, 15330, 7337, 476, 9555, 5128, 315, 8149, 659, 576, 15010, 6682, 429, 279, 38159, 315, 38562, 95051, 1410, 387, 264, 3491, 369, 438, 1293, 438, 2326, 1635, 1576, 8654, 16982, 525, 32894, 279, 5726, 315, 16621, 311, 5155, 264, 7826, 70722, 315, 10163, 659, 576, 3200, 745, 23368, 1922, 315, 12785, 5670, 304, 8257, 11052, 304, 6702, 369, 279, 1156, 882, 2474, 5768, 220, 16, 24, 22, 18, 659, 576, 17704, 572, 30188, 304, 11673, 315, 34650, 5590, 1154, 58963, 73185, 1154, 323, 5670, 315, 58963, 13904, 25266, 659, 17715, 78749, 38562, 1154, 11673, 315, 34650, 5590, 702, 24938, 1576, 315, 279, 13951, 315, 12728, 29500, 315, 34650, 659, 2411, 279, 1852, 882, 1154, 66176, 315, 34650, 5590, 614, 19590, 311, 279, 13951, 304, 73185, 5702, 1154, 7892, 304, 3213, 5555, 15202, 614, 1012, 7046, 1091, 807, 1033, 6788, 29099, 311, 387, 659, 61043, 26644, 23766, 82, 369, 30186, 323, 13404, 614, 1083, 13515, 42768, 73185, 659, 362, 10572, 315, 16621, 3118, 304, 8257, 14807, 429, 1657, 18809, 525, 4633, 1917, 311, 5591, 12192, 58963, 476, 58963, 13904, 3871, 659, 5976, 1657, 9675, 33970, 911, 803, 7199, 16720, 323, 16062, 7576, 1154, 1052, 374, 902, 5904, 429, 58963, 476, 5435, 3871, 525, 650, 674, 22921, 480, 6762, 12472, 1134, 1033, 4961, 304, 67286, 1154, 2048, 47664, 1154, 323, 32780, 10416, 1154, 714, 1657, 16621, 9324, 1101, 438, 11658, 911, 279, 81384, 315, 2477, 6862, 39999, 7236, 1741, 438, 9509, 1154, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 481, 15, 13, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3493233300, 'load_duration': 31460200, 'prompt_eval_count': 337, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1010979000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2447471000}"
77,"September 5 , 1974 An informal poll of director opinion reveals a considerable deterioration in expectations tied mainly to the slump in stock market prices . Concern over bank liquidity and credit quality is evident , but primary worries are on the status of the economy . Most directors believe the nation will be facing very difficult business conditions for at least the remainder of 1974 . However , most also believe we have no choice but to stay with a heavily restrictive monetary policy to dampen inflation . They believe that possible increased restraint in fiscal policy might permit some modest easing of credit restraint . Increased output of petrochemicals accounts for much of the continued growth in industrial production in the Eleventh District . Petroleum refining has grown steadily since March when foreign oil began flowing to Texas refineries . Crude runs to stills have now climbed well above the levels that prevailed prior to the Arab oil embargo , and expanded refinery output has increased feedstocks to chemical producers who are hard pressed to meet soaring demand . Industrial production has also been boosted by gains in textile output . Shortages of fibers have eased and have allowed textile producers to replace badly depleted inventories of finished goods . Paper producers , on the other hand , report the availability of wood pulp remains tight , but they have been able to increase output nonetheless .

The boom in drilling continues , although constrained by availability of equipment and trained manpower .

78,", but the decline in red meat prices has been 3 percent or less . This reluctance to pass lower meat animal prices on to the consumer has slowed the movement of meat through the marketing chain and has contributed to an oversupply of heavy animals . Consequently , the livestock industry continues in a depressed financial state . However , on the basis of a recent telephone survey to a limited number of commercial bankers , most cattle loans have been adequately secured during the past year , thereby minimizing the number of bad loans . It was reported that a few rural banks may be in jeopardy because of poor cattle paper . The District 's wheat situation has not improved since the last Red Book . Various reports indicate that drought has destroyed much of the crop in New Mexico and Colorado . Given the recent planting difficulties in the spring wheat regions , 1974 wheat production may fall short of official estimates . However , the crop is still expected to surpass last year 's record of 1.7 billion bushels .

Industries closely related to housing and consumer durables ( lumber , glass , textiles , furniture , and appliances ) are noticeably weaker . In addition , several Districts ( New York , Chicago , Kansas City , and San Francisco ) report that some industrial materials , particularly fuels , certain chemicals , and paper , are more readily available . The easing of supply constraints in these industries is contributing to less aggressive purchasing and some declines in order backlogs . Cleveland , Chicago , Kansas City , and Dallas indicate somewhat softer prices for chemicals , fuels , and other materials , but no major break in industrial prices has occurred to date . Steel markets remain tight in most Districts , due in part to the prospective coal strike . Both Cleveland and San Francisco suggest an easing in the steel situation in coming months , however , due to the increased availability of foreign steel . The agricultural outlook appears generally weaker . Atlanta reports favorable harvest yields with the exception of the hurricane-damaged Louisiana sugar cane crop . But Chicago , St. Louis , Minneapolis , and Kansas City indicate that early frosts will substantially reduce corn and soybean yields , reducing farm incomes and increasing feed costs .

High financing costs , as well as shortages , may be inhibiting inventory investment in some sectors , and little evidence of excessive inventory accumulation was noted . Most respondents perceived little or no indications that shortages and capacity limitations were easing up . Among others , the president of a multinational chemical corporation reported continuous shortages and capacity limitations in his industry , while a senior official of a nationwide chain of department stores noted that many items were still not available .

The respondents generally expected further significant price increases . Consumer outlays remained relatively strong in the New York City area , but some weakening was noted upstate . Construction is expected to be further adversely affected by the rise in short-term interest rates and the resulting outflow of funds from thrift institutions . Views regarding the prospective demand for short-term business credit were mixed but on balance pointed to a sustained strong demand . The directors in general agreed that the slackening in business activity which has occurred in recent months is likely to be followed by an improvement as the year wears on . The president of a large chemical corporation thus characterized the slack in the economy as minor , and the president of a large nationwide retail concern looked for some improvement in the second half of the year . The president of a multinational nonferrous metal concern expected a moderate increase in real GNP for the year as a whole . Another director reported strength in the airline , semiconductor , and media industries .

He notes that a 5 percent funds rate accompanies 8.3 percent money growth in his model—this is close enough to 7.5 percent to be well within our margins of forecasting and control errors .

He sees no rebound in housing or autos for some time , but it is a good bet that growth will exceed 4 to 5",0.3,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:35:04.009418Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": 0.3\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 437, 24527, 659, 1260, 1035, 1075, 311, 1490, 264, 27957, 4722, 6775, 10514, 4379, 33256, 448, 3220, 6513, 315, 220, 16, 15, 3266, 369, 264, 2421, 3951, 659, 1260, 23209, 429, 3498, 2513, 1401, 4751, 37550, 389, 1156, 69226, 1154, 279, 8584, 702, 902, 9963, 2355, 21677, 5896, 2971, 315, 2562, 5310, 374, 91971, 323, 582, 5214, 53263, 367, 421, 279, 41532, 374, 537, 59096, 3073, 659, 1260, 15634, 2477, 1645, 15859, 8437, 10416, 287, 264, 220, 21, 3266, 24527, 4379, 1265, 220, 19, 3266, 6513, 387, 62160, 2587, 220, 22, 13, 20, 3266, 3220, 6513, 1035, 5214, 2441, 85728, 659, 1205, 1184, 537, 5296, 279, 42166, 518, 5080, 7813, 315, 3220, 14461, 2587, 582, 1184, 311, 7789, 279, 13351, 659, 81640, 12429, 8388, 429, 279, 8584, 374, 2058, 42493, 7469, 1154, 323, 806, 50065, 525, 9902, 264, 63801, 429, 279, 3742, 3931, 686, 975, 3355, 323, 429, 32284, 4842, 374, 12647, 22160, 659, 1260, 374, 52364, 448, 279, 990, 315, 279, 6775, 10514, 4379, 438, 264, 2169, 323, 566, 374, 50412, 311, 1490, 429, 432, 702, 94882, 14400, 659, 1260, 8388, 429, 264, 220, 20, 3266, 10514, 4379, 48056, 220, 23, 13, 18, 3266, 3220, 6513, 304, 806, 1614, 2293, 574, 374, 3265, 3322, 311, 220, 22, 13, 20, 3266, 311, 387, 1632, 2878, 1039, 36582, 315, 78382, 323, 2524, 5975, 659, 20924, 3266, 3220, 6513, 1035, 8193, 264, 18210, 323, 1035, 387, 49334, 1172, 421, 24527, 17066, 311, 279, 220, 16, 311, 220, 17, 3266, 2188, 659, 31907, 930, 37107, 429, 279, 77965, 374, 3143, 659, 1260, 15634, 902, 41532, 304, 11721, 476, 46872, 369, 1045, 882, 1154, 714, 432, 374, 264, 1661, 1274, 429, 6513, 686, 12488, 220, 19, 311, 220, 20, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 1, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 18, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3188662400, 'load_duration': 26807600, 'prompt_eval_count': 339, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1050844000, 'eval_count': 12, 'eval_duration': 2108411000}"

A major heavy-duty truck manufacturer in Cleveland recently closed its plant for a week , and reopened with operations reduced by one-third . Truck suppliers and some machinery firms are laying off workers . A major machine tool company in Cleveland said cancelled machine tool orders exceeded new orders in January for the third consecutive month .

Today , foreign mills , particularly Japanese producers , are undercutting domestic steel prices by 20 to 25 percent . The sluggish pace of construction activity has led to extremely aggressive bidding by manufacturers of building materials for new projects . A Fort Worth manufacturer of reinforcing steel bars said mills are engaged in the most aggressive price-cutting that he has seen in 25 years in the industry . Many jobs are actually being bid below cost as mills try to keep their share of the market and attempt to hold on to the backbone of their work force . A survey of independent oil producers reveals a consensus of opinion that the proposed energy legislation before Congress would be a disaster if enacted . The respondents feel changes are due but not in the direction of those proposed . Not only would changes now being considered roll back crude oil prices from an average of $ 8.75 per barrel to $ 7.66 , but legislation would tighten the rules expensing intangible drilling costs . The latter change would reduce funds available for drilling and impact most severely on small independents , who account for much exploratory drilling .

One positive sign has been a sharp decrease in the number of applications for debt consolidation loans this year . Credit card usage is on the rise , and suburban bankers note that automobile loans have picked up . In addition , there are numerous reports of banks offering comprehensive service packages in attempts to rekindle consumer borrowing . Good harvests , increased marketings of cattle , and higher average prices since midyear have bolstered crop and livestock sales in the Eleventh District . Consequently , cash flows to farmers and ranches have improved , and rural bankers report the rate of loan repayment has increased while the number of renewals and extensions has declined . Although flush with funds , agribankers continue to be very cautious in granting credit . Uncertainty over markets and weather and the carryover effects of depressed incomes in 1974 , particularly among cattle feeders , serve to keep collateral requirements firm . Nevertheless , agricultural lending this fall is above year-earlier levels . Rising production costs and slightly more acreage in cultivation have increased the farmer 's demand for bank credit .

102,"March 12 , 1975 Recent evidence indicates further weakening in District business activity . Unemployment rose sharply in January , and manufacturers are not so optimistic as they were last November . Nevertheless , bank directors cited several sectors where business activity has improved . In addition , directors report that District businesses have not been confronted with overly excessive inventories ; inflationary pressures have also eased . The District 's rural areas continue to be relatively unaffected by the recession . Unemployment continues to rise . The District 's unemployment rate , seasonally adjusted , increased from 5.9 percent to 6.4 percent between December and January , with the Minneapolis-St. Paul area rate jumping from 5.1 percent to 6.2 percent . In early 1975 , District help-wanted advertising was down 30 percent from a year ago and initial claims for unemployment insurance were up 35 percent . District manufacturers are not so optimistic about their sales outlook as they were last November . After increasing 15.9 percent from a year earlier in the fourth quarter , District manufacturers look for their sales to surpass year-ago levels by around 9 percent during the first nine months of this year .

Recent figures , though improved from the beginning of this year , were well below the numbers issued in the early 1970s . Also , district nonresidential building spending remained down from a year ago . Savings deposit growth at district commercial banks and savings and loan associations slowed somewhat in the third quarter , following rapid growth during the first half of 1975 . The slowdown largely reflected the growing attractiveness of U.S. Government Securities , whose yields have risen above the highest rates that savings institutions are permitted to pay . Mortgage loans closed and mortgage loan commitments by district S & Ls continued to climb rapidly in the third quarter . However , if past relationships prevail , S & Ls will soon be scaling back the volume of new loan commitments to match the slower savings growth .

Retail sales in most areas over the holiday season were only equal or barely above last year 's level in dollar terms and , given the sharp rise in retail prices over the past year , lower in volume . Moreover , this year 's level was achieved only by dint of heavy pre-Christmas aggressive promotion , special sales , and price cutting in addition to the usual early January clearance sales . Against this background , a number of respondents in various Districts regarded retail inventories to be relatively high to excessive in relation to current sale prospects , with increased reports of efforts to reduce positions , both at the retail and manufacturing level . Planned business plant and equipment outlays , apart from energy related industries , on balance appeared to be weaker than had been expected , and a number of Districts report cutbacks , or outright cancellations of planned projects . The private residential construction , and to a lesser extent commercial construction , picture remained bleak , although a reported moderate reversal in the outflow of deposits at thrift institutions gives hope that the eventual bottoming of the decline in that industry may be approaching .

In fact , none of the manufacturers surveyed reported paying lower prices this month , and none expect to be paying lower ones by next January . Merchants in the area report that retail sales are running slightly ahead of their projections .

From around the District reports of plant closings and layoffs continue across a broad range of industries . Recent announcements involve such industries as printing , chemicals , shipbuilding , electrical equipment , and rubber . Meanwhile , actual and potential disruptions of natural gas supplies are contributing to uncertainties in parts of the District . Our survey of District retailers yields much the same picture . Sales declined in January following an increase in December , while sales of big ticket items continue weak . Responses indicate a reduction in retail inventories for the first time in 7 months , although 50 percent of the retailers still view current levels as excessive . An exception to this situation seems to have developed with regard to sales of new automobiles . The sales policies initiated by the manufacturers have given a significant boost to sales in this sector . Although no trend is discernible at this time , there is some indication of a slowing of price increases .

None of these merchants report encountering resistance from customers . Several stores mention a very gradual increase in the percentage of goods purchased on credit , although the percentage of cash purchases remains above pre-recession norms . One report was received of an effort to encourage new credit accounts as well as greater use of existing ones . Other comments from retailers indicate that the solid sales gains achieved during and after the holiday season were attained without markdowns and heavy promotions which characterized retailing in late 1974 . The profit outlook is , therefore , much improved . Retailers note that , as a result of reduced manufacturers ' inventories , goods obtained at low prices for use during promotions are very scarce .

112,"November 10 , 1976 The New England Directors are confident that the recovery will continue well into 1977 , but they have reported a recent loss of momentum in business activity , indicating slower growth . Loan demand remains weak ; manufacturing capacity is generally excessive in the First District ; and retail sales have improved in recent weeks . Banking directors report that businessmen , on balance , are attempting to reduce their reliance on bank loans . Firms are still issuing medium and long-term debt to improve the structure of their balance sheets . Bankers are particularly disappointed by the lack of demand for inventory financing . However , competition for loan customers has not led to discounts on the effective interest rate for loans . In fact , bankers are concerned about yields on business loans dropping too low : work-outs have reduced earnings , while write-offs have been and continue to be heavy . The pace of retail sales is not uniform throughout the district . While some retailers were especially pleased with the strength of October 's sales , others have noted only moderate improvement recently . Overall , retailers are exercising caution : `` although it is human nature to respond to increased sales , it is important to closely control stock and liquidity .

Appliance sales are far below expectations . Agricultural harvests are ahead of normal schedules . Lenders of all types have ample funds . Many firms experienced losses as a result of the devaluation of the Mexican peso . Although forecasts of the rate of expansion are more subdued and cautious , there seems to be no expectation that a recession is imminent . In fact , more analysts now anticipate that the upswing will continue into 1978 . The recent slowdown suggests to them that satisfaction of various demands is being pushed into the future . Sales of heavy trucks and trailers are well above last year and further gains are expected for 1977 , but the size of the expected increase in sales has been reduced . Orders for large outdoor cranes and some other types of construction equipment have picked up recently from depressed levels .

But even stronger demand for construction materials may not help the steel industry because as much as three-fourths of the current production of some firms goes into oil field equipment manufacturing which is now beginning to soften . In addition , aluminum output continues at the low level established last summer . Domestic drilling activity has taken a turn for the worse . After reaching a 14-year high in late December , the total number of active rotary drilling rigs dropped 16 percent to a 17-month low in March . A seasonal decline in drilling is expected in the first quarter of each year ; but according to some industry spokesmen , the cutback was also in response to a rollback in the average price of domestic crude oil to $ 7.66 a barrel—down from the January high of $ 8.43 . Many drilling contractors expect the decline to slow and drilling to begin a seasonal upswing in the last half of the year . However , the future is clouded by proposed legislation that is unfavorable to the industry . Despite the sharp drop in rig count , more wells were completed in the first quarter of 1976 than in the comparable period last year . Multi-family construction in the Eleventh District remains severely depressed by high interest rates and rising construction costs .

117,"quarter of 1975 . For the month ended January 15 , prices received by farmers dropped 0.5 percent following a modest increase in December . Given the evidence of increased cattle placements in feedlots during the fourth quarter , together with the beginning of an expansion in hog farrowings , meat supplies in 1976 promise to be large enough to offer some stability to retail prices—assuming that the farm-to-retail margins do not widen significantly . The winter wheat situation in the District is still hanging in the balance due to the lack of moisture . Several stories of farmers abandoning the crop , taking steps to prevent wind erosion where there is no wheat , and applying for disaster payments have been reported in the news media . However , a large crop is still possible if the weather cooperates over the next few months . And , if crop producers follow through with their intentions as reported in January , the production of most crops in 1976 will likely be large enough to restrain any sharp rise in prices .

Nonetheless , survey results indicate that manufacturing sales expectations are improving . The overall employment picture was somewhat brighter than in the manufacturing sector .

Most directors reported quite strong residential construction activity but mostly in just the single-family market . A director whose firm is a major producer of temperature controls cited information indicating that single-family construction was much stronger in the Ninth District than in the nation . He expected that strength to increase in the third quarter . With regard to apartment building , he mentioned a national association of home builders survey , which found a rather sharp second-quarter recovery in multifamily construction that was expected to gain momentum during the remainder of 1976 and into 1977 . Also , a recent Twin Cities metropolitan area apartment survey reported that vacancy rates had declined to quite a low level , a usual sign that a pickup is due . However , many observers felt that rental rates were not high enough to justify new apartment construction in the District . Reports from directors on building activity in their respective areas showed nonresidential construction weaker than residential construction . However , the director whose firm manufactures temperature controls believed nonresidential construction had begun to recover and should be very strong by 1977 , up 10 to 15 percent in constant terms .

The picture is still far from rosy , but the outlook is distinctly more optimistic . Even though capital goods industries are still weak , the rest of the manufacturing sector is gaining strength . Inventories have been brought into line with sales and new orders are up .

While there is little disagreement that `` catch-up '' efforts in wage negotiations scheduled for 1976 pose a problem for stabilizing production costs , there are differences of opinion on the likelihood that food prices will rise significantly during the next few months . The financial sector continues to build liquidity rather than expand . Savings are flowing into commercial banks and thrift institutions at very rapid rates . This is putting downward pressure on mortgage rates . However , despite low interest rates for business loans , demand for credit remains sluggish . Reports from 10 of the 12 Districts indicate that the surge of retail sales experienced in December was no fluke .

Several Districts report spurts in retail sales in August , but few report signs of strengthening in manufacturing and housing . The recovery in capital goods continues at a gradual and uneven pace , and the outlook does not suggest substantial acceleration in the short-term . Concern over possible shortages and bottlenecks appears to have diminished with the slower rate of recovery . Business loan demand remains weak , and there is little indication of much revival for the next several months . Drought , especially in the corn belt , has reduced harvest prospects for corn , soybeans and cotton , suggesting possible upward price pressures for those crops and for cattle . Most Districts report a spurt in consumer sales in August . The pickup reported in most areas was mixed , but New York was especially encouraged by `` substantial momentum in recent weeks '' across all product lines . New car sales were strong across the nation , but other big-ticket items and the tourist trade moved well only in some Districts . The outlook for consumer spending for the rest of the year ranged from continued steady improvement in Philadelphia , Cleveland , Chicago , and San Francisco to little change in Richmond .

In addition , all of the merchants contacted indicate that present sales levels are above their expectations for this period . In general , the strength in sales at most stores is reported to be broad-based , but certain items are singled out as strong sellers . For example , one retailer notes a resurgence in lower-priced durables such as small electrical appliances priced under $ 50 . He adds , however , that the bulk of the strength is in soft goods , especially apparel .

Among the manufacturers surveyed , however , expectations of improvements in the level of production in their own firms are slightly less common than a month ago . Survey respondents , both retail and manufacturing , report widespread increases in prices paid , but relatively few such increases in the prices received . Nearly 50 percent of all respondents report paying higher prices during the latest survey period , while fewer than 20 percent report increases in prices received and over 12 percent report receiving lower prices . In the banking sector , there appears to be a moderate upward trend developing in the demand for business loans , which recently has drawn strength from the wholesale and retail trade sectors . Business loan demand is certainly not at desired levels , however , and investment in bankers ' acceptances continues . Both consumer installment and real estate loans show continued strength . The District 's farm income situation improved during August , largely because marketing of the flue-cured crop was well underway and prices were up sharply from last year . With this improvement , total cash farm income for the January-August period registered a 5 percent gain over a year earlier compared with 1 percent at the end of July .

129,"September 15 , 1976 Judging from our latest survey of Fifth District business conditions , the level of activity among manufacturers showed little change in the past month . The level of shipments , in fact , has remained essentially unchanged since June , while the volume of new orders has registered minimal declines in each of the past 3 months . Backlogs of orders and finished goods inventories are down somewhat from July , and stocks of materials are reported to have risen slightly since then . Manufacturing inventories remain somewhat above desired levels as does current plant and equipment capacity . Retailers apparently experienced some improvement in sales during August , but at least one respondent attributes this to heavy price markdowns . Sales of big-ticket items continue to lag relative to total sales . Demand for bank loans remains soft . In the agricultural sector , dry weather for the past several weeks has damaged pastures and most major crops in wide areas of the District . Survey responses of District manufacturers exhibit much the same pattern as in the past 2 months , suggesting a stable level of shipments , some weakness in the volume of new orders , and a small decline in order backlogs . Some accumulation of materials inventories in August is indicated , but over one-third of the respondents report reduced stocks of finished goods . Thirty-seven percent of the manufacturers still feel current inventory levels are higher than desired .

The effect appears to be more through holding down imports , rather than through increasing exports . Business managers are displeased with the energy program that appears to be shaping up in legislation now under consideration . They insist that incentives to develop new supplies are inadequate and that proposed measures to reduce consumption would be inefficient and vary costly to implement .

Consumer spending continues vigorous , especially for durables . The housing market has lost some of the `` frenzy '' of last spring but retains great momentum . Crops are growing well in virtually all areas of the district . Few basic products , either raw materials or components , are in short supply , but there are complaints of limited availability of rail and highway transportation . A major producer of building materials , for example , says both freight cars and trailers have been short and some units furnished have not been usable . An analyst of the trucking industry has argued for several months that a capacity crush was developing in highway transport and that orders for new trucks and trailers , while up sharply from last year , were not rising at an adequate pace . A major Western railroad has been pleased with the pickup in important classes of traffic this year . This line recently ordered 124 new locomotives , compared to none in 1976 .

Copper and scrap inventories held by one firm are reported to be at an all-time high and will likely be cut . Crude oil and gasoline stocks continue at levels well above a year ago , although one refinery reported a rather sizable reduction in gasoline stocks during August . On the other hand , distillate and residual fuel stocks are only slightly above last year 's levels and as sane producers will apparently aim to increase those stocks . Directors and officials associated with consumer goods are mixed in their views about prospects for consumer spending . Even though sales gains in August were large relative to a year earlier , some retailers remain cautious . A director of a department store chain cautions that slower gains in income and an unsustainably high proportion of expenditures for automotive and luxury-type goods would likely hold down future consumer spending . An economist in retail trade expects slower growth in disposable income and increased personal saving rates will hold overall gains in real consumer expenditures to about a 3 % annual rate of increase this half . He does not believe that the rapid rate of increase in retail sales last month can be sustained , nor is it consistent with forecasts of only 4-to-5 % quarterly gains",-0.2,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:37:31.9057348Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": -0.2\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 5075, 1537, 1042, 659, 3776, 45115, 17530, 429, 9509, 17023, 2433, 5023, 525, 1172, 10078, 3403, 1846, 2337, 77965, 82, 304, 220, 16, 24, 22, 15, 12, 16, 24, 22, 16, 323, 3309, 220, 16, 24, 22, 21, 1154, 304, 33681, 315, 279, 2097, 429, 15293, 374, 32352, 5080, 1091, 304, 1846, 18346, 659, 42540, 323, 20843, 17023, 2433, 5644, 553, 825, 7474, 525, 4961, 311, 387, 518, 458, 678, 7246, 1550, 323, 686, 4363, 387, 3931, 659, 4553, 793, 5590, 323, 45495, 22488, 3060, 518, 5866, 1632, 3403, 264, 1042, 4134, 1154, 7892, 825, 93634, 4961, 264, 4751, 78098, 13951, 304, 45495, 22488, 2337, 6156, 659, 1913, 279, 1008, 1424, 1154, 1582, 483, 349, 323, 32147, 10416, 22488, 525, 1172, 10078, 3403, 1537, 1042, 364, 82, 5866, 323, 438, 61100, 23308, 686, 13812, 9213, 311, 5263, 1846, 22488, 659, 44985, 323, 7359, 5815, 448, 11502, 11561, 525, 9519, 304, 862, 6194, 911, 26851, 369, 11502, 10164, 659, 7418, 3498, 6625, 19619, 304, 6156, 1033, 3460, 8674, 311, 264, 1042, 6788, 1154, 1045, 29182, 7146, 45778, 659, 362, 7538, 315, 264, 9292, 3553, 8781, 2162, 3977, 429, 28393, 19619, 304, 7911, 323, 458, 6975, 30773, 2845, 1550, 21117, 315, 52769, 369, 39408, 323, 19352, 10604, 11561, 1035, 4363, 3331, 1495, 3853, 11502, 10164, 659, 1527, 45115, 304, 10806, 6559, 24297, 28393, 6513, 304, 43790, 7911, 323, 7172, 4345, 13997, 7813, 686, 3331, 8084, 19619, 304, 1931, 11502, 52769, 311, 911, 264, 220, 18, 1018, 9775, 4379, 315, 5263, 419, 4279, 659, 1260, 1558, 537, 4411, 429, 279, 11048, 4379, 315, 5263, 304, 10806, 6625, 1537, 2254, 646, 387, 28659, 1154, 6329, 374, 432, 12966, 448, 50065, 315, 1172, 220, 19, 4686, 12, 20, 1018, 50434, 19619, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 1, 24512, 3819, 788, 481, 15, 13, 17, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3367892900, 'load_duration': 27034800, 'prompt_eval_count': 340, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1072707000, 'eval_count': 12, 'eval_duration': 2265814000}"

Capital goods recovery continues rather mixed . Bankers report strong loan demand and a few expect liquidity pressures may develop in the months ahead . Directors , financial officers , and economists contacted generally expressed confidence that the economy will continue to expand for the next several quarters but at a moderated pace from the first half of 1977 .

The recent surge in steel output , supported by a high level of auto production and inventory buildup , is expected to end shortly .

Retailers indicated a mixed pattern of consumer spending over the past several weeks . Some department store officials are concerned about near-term sales prospects . One reported sales in May were a bit better than in April although still below expectations in real terms .

Residential construction remains strong , while nonresidential construction activity is making a year-end surge . But industry spokesmen predict a slowing in construction activity by mid-1978 . The demand for home mortgages remains very active , but savings and loan associations suggest market demands will slow in coming months . Most petroleum refiners continue to put aside plans for plant and equipment spending until a national energy policy is established . Because profit margins have improved , the number of cattle on feed in Texas is up sharply from the level a year ago . Department store executives indicate Christmas sales should be excellent this year . Thanksgiving sales were l4 percent above a year ago , end December sales may well top that rate of increase . Although consumers continue to be price and quality conscious and are making practical gift selections , many show a ready willingness to buy expensive gifts .

144,"planting is running on or ahead of schedule , and in the southern part of the District the wheat has germinated and is beginning to grow . According to one director from an agricultural area , the quality of the wheat stand is excellent and the crop prospects for the coming year are `` very good when compared with this time last year . '' If the new crop continues to receive rain , wheat pasture will be available for grazing and some ranchers will probably take advantage of this cheap source of feed . Thus , prices for light cattle may strengthen as a result of this activity . Because most farmers were uncertain about the details of the new farm program when they started planting their wheat , acreage in the District 's major producing states is expected to be about equal to 1977 levels . However , as farmers become more familiar with the program , some of the crop will probably be destroyed so that their eligibility for full Government benefits will not be jeopardized . This strategy may be employed because , with the huge stocks of wheat now on hand , the price outlook for the coming year is not bright for producers . Most Tenth District bankers contacted report strong loan demand , especially in energy-related businesses and in real estate loans , both residential and commercial . Consumer installment lending is also increasing rapidly , with credit card use and auto loans responsible for most of the gains",0.75,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:37:45.9069636Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.75\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 20827, 287, 374, 4303, 389, 476, 8305, 315, 9700, 1154, 323, 304, 279, 18070, 949, 315, 279, 10942, 279, 33053, 702, 17239, 51199, 323, 374, 7167, 311, 3063, 659, 10548, 311, 825, 7538, 504, 458, 28049, 3082, 1154, 279, 4271, 315, 279, 33053, 2498, 374, 9073, 323, 279, 19097, 26851, 369, 279, 5001, 1042, 525, 9902, 1602, 1661, 979, 7707, 448, 419, 882, 1537, 1042, 659, 3355, 1416, 279, 501, 19097, 9539, 311, 5258, 11174, 1154, 33053, 88255, 686, 387, 2500, 369, 83450, 323, 1045, 38061, 388, 686, 4658, 1896, 9423, 315, 419, 11872, 2530, 315, 5395, 659, 14301, 1154, 7576, 369, 3100, 35852, 1231, 19681, 438, 264, 1102, 315, 419, 5702, 659, 9211, 1429, 20336, 1033, 35118, 911, 279, 3565, 315, 279, 501, 8785, 2025, 979, 807, 3855, 47014, 862, 33053, 1154, 45223, 424, 304, 279, 10942, 364, 82, 3598, 17387, 5302, 374, 3601, 311, 387, 911, 6144, 311, 220, 16, 24, 22, 22, 5866, 659, 4354, 1154, 438, 20336, 3635, 803, 11285, 448, 279, 2025, 1154, 1045, 315, 279, 19097, 686, 4658, 387, 14425, 773, 429, 862, 40634, 369, 2480, 10212, 7567, 686, 537, 387, 52032, 1506, 659, 1096, 8282, 1231, 387, 19446, 1576, 1154, 448, 279, 6765, 22488, 315, 33053, 1431, 389, 1424, 1154, 279, 3349, 35621, 369, 279, 5001, 1042, 374, 537, 9906, 369, 23308, 659, 7496, 350, 20684, 10942, 63143, 24542, 1895, 3746, 11679, 7479, 1154, 5310, 304, 4802, 13904, 9675, 323, 304, 1931, 12394, 16606, 1154, 2176, 20057, 323, 8353, 659, 25197, 46544, 39551, 374, 1083, 7703, 18512, 1154, 448, 6668, 3701, 990, 323, 3233, 16606, 8480, 369, 1429, 315, 279, 19619, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 22, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3700789800, 'load_duration': 14276400, 'prompt_eval_count': 322, 'prompt_eval_duration': 997831000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 2687049000}"

However , directors ' comments indicate that uncertainty about the Administration 's economic policies is holding back some investment spending . Strong retail and manufacturing sales ...

During the first nine months of this year , manufacturing sales were up about 14 percent from a year ago , but in August manufacturers expected only a 10 percent increase in the fourth quarter . In November , however , manufacturers reported a fourth-quarter sales gain about the same size as the rest of the year ( with durable goods sales up 17 percent ; nondurable goods sales , 11 percent ) .

Pacing the gain in consumer durables were sales of air conditioners and fans , which swelled in the wake of the heat wave that gripped the District . Respondents generally reported that inventory levels were building up . While some retailers professed little concern over this development in view of the favorable outlook for merchandising , others were less sanguine . One executive of a national retail chain indicated that all divisions had exceeded their budgets , tying up more funds in inventories than was desired . Industrial respondents also reported increases in inventories . For the most part , inventory levels were not felt to be seriously out of line with shipments , although some metal fabricators did regard their stocks of raw materials as excessive . A director noted other scattered instances of unwanted inventory build-up . Reports on capital spending were mixed . On the one hand , several upstate machine and tool makers found new orders increasing smartly . One firm attributed the upward trend in orders to the strengthening of the automotive sector in western New York State . In response to a pickup in demand , one steel maker recently reactivated a blast furnace that had been closed since late last year .

154,"September 14 , 1977 Retail sales continue strong in the west , with an emphasis on autos and appliances . Capital spending , on the other hand , continues generally weak , with a quite visible portion of this spending being used for pollution control . Residential construction remains strong , though the rate of increase has plateaued in most areas . Because of low grain prices and high drought-induced production costs , many Western farmers are experiencing serious cash-flow problems and rural economies are somewhat depressed . The much-noted forest fires of the west have been mainly confined to wilderness and park areas and are unlikely to have any noticeable impact on the timber supply . Retail sales continue strong throughout the district . In Salt Lake City , sales of appliances and other big ticket items are matching the rapid pace of residential construction . The largest gains of the year are currently being experienced by Portland 's largest department store . A northwestern distributor of foreign cars reported the best August since 1973 , with sales up 42 % from July . Several areas in both southern California and Idaho reported that retail sales continue to increase at 15 percent over 1976 . Capital spending still appears generally weak in the West . One Oregon bank reported that most of its commercial loans were for debt restructuring or acquisition of other companies . Another Oregon bank observed that much investment was for transportation items .

A representative of a major chemical company noted that demand has remained strong for most products with the exception of a slight reduction in demand for some fibers . Representatives of other manufacturing concerns , such as apparel , paper , beer , food products , appliances and consumer tools , indicate a continuing growth in demand . Orders and production in several capital goods industries have picked up in the past couple of months , although reporters point out that boom conditions have not developed . Orders for large electrical motors , thermostats and other control devices , industrial screws and bolts , fabricated products , railroad cars , and industrial lubricating equipment were reported to have increased recently . Representatives of the aircraft industry also reported a high level of activity . On the other hand , orders for such items as telecommunications equipment , farm equipment , and radiators for heavy equipment were reported to have remained relatively stable . While recent gains have occurred in the capital goods industry , the general consensus among businessmen is that the President 's energy proposals will have adverse effects on capital spending in the near term . It is the businessmen 's view that the proposals have created more uncertainty , and hence , have increased the difficulty of predicting costs . This will tend to discourage a marginal amount of investment for the time being .

159,"fixed exchange rates is of singular importance . On the other hand , when our major creditor , Saudi Arabia , insists that something be done , token intervention may be a wise near-term political expedient . Houthakker believes intervention may occasionally be necessary when market conditions become disorderly as may have been the case in the early days of the new year . Further intervention , however , is not necessary and not in the best interests of the United States . Lower import prices would help meet Germany 's and Japan 's concern about inflation and provide them with more elbow room to pursue expansionary policies . Although declines in the dollar do contribute to our inflation , the magnitude of the impact so far is one we can live with . Unlike 1972 and 1973 , the rise in the prices of our imports have not been accompanied by sharp increases in the price of exported goods . Tobin does not object to short-run intervention to stabilize irrational day-to-day speculation but does oppose trying to peg the exchange rate . Tobin doubts that the dollar would be overvalued if Germany and Japan were operating at reasonable levels of capacity , and questions whether it is overvalued anyway . Recent declines reflect portfolio shifts by OPEC investors that have little to do with the fundamental value of the dollar . A policy which would enhance confidence in the economic recovery and boost the stock market would help to restore the capital inflow .

Retailers are somewhat apprehensive about the future course of the economy and some feel that inventories may be a bit high ; but this concern is not based on actual experience . Both a major department store chain and a large utility report that uncollectible bills and bad debts , which increase as the economy weakens , are low and falling . The region 's economists are , for the most part , considerably more pessimistic about the economic outlook than are most businessmen . At a recent gathering of business economists nine out of twelve assigned a probability in excess of 50 percent to the prospect of a recession in late 1978 or early 1979 . Consumer debt , the rate of inflation and the Federal Reserve 's response were the basis for their gloomy forecasts . Professors Eckstein and Samuelson were available for comment this month . Both respondents agree that there is a very real possibility of a `` credit crunch '' developing in the second half of this year , although neither believes that the present level of interest rates will necessarily lead to this outcome . They also agreed that while an overly ambitious attempt to slow the rate of money growth could easily produce a recession , the economy 's prospects in the absence of this policy are for slower but still acceptable real growth in the months immediately ahead .",0.2,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:38:41.7134418Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.2\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 19742, 279, 1156, 2003, 315, 5768, 659, 576, 29970, 4958, 304, 18172, 1532, 9448, 374, 3041, 287, 1602, 1632, 659, 34039, 388, 525, 14400, 46191, 4025, 911, 279, 3853, 3308, 315, 279, 8584, 323, 1045, 2666, 429, 17023, 2433, 1231, 387, 264, 2699, 1550, 2587, 714, 419, 4643, 374, 537, 3118, 389, 5042, 3139, 659, 11733, 264, 3598, 9292, 3553, 8781, 323, 264, 3460, 15549, 1895, 429, 650, 17384, 1238, 18610, 323, 3873, 44205, 1154, 892, 5263, 438, 279, 8584, 7469, 724, 1154, 525, 3347, 323, 15679, 659, 576, 5537, 364, 82, 44315, 525, 1154, 369, 279, 1429, 949, 1154, 32352, 803, 72523, 4532, 911, 279, 6955, 35621, 1091, 525, 1429, 82550, 659, 2411, 264, 3213, 22888, 315, 2562, 44315, 11627, 700, 315, 29235, 12607, 264, 18927, 304, 13623, 315, 220, 20, 15, 3266, 311, 279, 21479, 315, 264, 38521, 304, 3309, 220, 16, 24, 22, 23, 476, 4124, 220, 16, 24, 22, 24, 659, 25197, 11636, 1154, 279, 4379, 315, 24527, 323, 279, 12137, 24785, 364, 82, 2033, 1033, 279, 8037, 369, 862, 13701, 5533, 50065, 659, 8459, 433, 1087, 81640, 12429, 323, 31907, 930, 1033, 2500, 369, 3980, 419, 2254, 659, 11733, 33181, 7503, 429, 1052, 374, 264, 1602, 1931, 13038, 315, 264, 9902, 6668, 41734, 3355, 11220, 304, 279, 2086, 4279, 315, 419, 1042, 1154, 7892, 13866, 13605, 429, 279, 3042, 2188, 315, 2734, 7813, 686, 14312, 2990, 311, 419, 15274, 659, 2379, 1083, 7230, 429, 1393, 458, 38432, 31755, 4774, 311, 6301, 279, 4379, 315, 3220, 6513, 1410, 6707, 8193, 264, 38521, 1154, 279, 8584, 364, 82, 26851, 304, 279, 19265, 315, 419, 4842, 525, 369, 28393, 714, 2058, 21555, 1931, 6513, 304, 279, 3951, 7069, 8305, 659, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 17, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3581529500, 'load_duration': 11962800, 'prompt_eval_count': 336, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1005044000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2561193000}"
161,"March 15 , 1978 Business activity in the Seventh District was depressed by severe weather conditions in both January and February . The coal strike began to register an adverse impact on output in late February , but this influence is still relatively minor , and largely confined to Indiana . Some retailers are very pleased with recent sales , but others are not . There is evidence that consumers are holding back on purchases of autos and other big ticket items . Business capital outlays are expected to rise this year , both for equipment and structures . Demand for farm equipment is conspicuously weak . The long severe winter has hampered construction activity to an abnormal degree . Demand for credit appears to be strengthening , especially for bank loans to larger businesses . Interest rates are expected to move at least moderately higher as demand for credit increases while savings inflows to Thrift institutions remain slow . Knowledgeable business managers in the district believe that the coal strike negotiations have been `` bungled . '' The pact presented to the miners for ratification took away some benefits won earlier , and attempted to place unacceptable penalties on wildcat strikes . ( These views come from management observers . ) Nevertheless , a settlement is expected soon with various key sections rewritten . All affected activities are expected to rebound after the coal strike is settled . However , the experience adds to inflationary pressures .

162,"September 13 , 1978 The expansion in the Seventh District doubtless has slowed since the catchup period of lest spring , but there is no sign that a reversal is likely in the near future . Consumer spending continue to advance with rising incomes . Demand for workers remains strong and increases in compensation may be accelerating . There are few indications that inventories are excessive , and some items are in tight supply . Demand for capital goods is generally , but not universally , strong . Residential activity is holding up better than had been expected . Prospects for commercial and industrial construction are favorable . Corn and soybean crops are developing well . Informed people are deeply concerned about inflation , the foreign trade deficit , high taxes , and high interest rates , but there is no evidence of a rush to the storm cellars . In September 1974 , just before the sharp recession , there were significant signs that both consumers and businesses were holding back on spending decisions . Local polls of consumer sentiment reflect the widespread pessimism reported nationally . There is no clear evidence , however , that people are restraining their desires for goods and services .

The amount of office space under construction in the Dallas area has more than doubled since February to nearly 6.5 million square feet . Residential construction activity remains strong , although higher prices and mortgage rates are cutting into sales of new homes . The expansion in construction activity is hampered by shortages of cement , but surprisingly , prices have remained fairly stable . Recently , one major supplier attempted to raise prices but failed as other firms refused to follow suite . Imports of cement from Mexico are easing shortages in some areas , and there are several new cement plants under construction in Texas . Prices of other building materials in short supply are responding to the demand pressures . Demand for real estate and construction loans is leading the rise in lending activity at commercial banks . Some of the recent real estate loans were to applicants turning to banks because S & Ls were unable to meet their requests . Banks are becoming increasingly concerned about their liquidity positions . Loan volume at District banks is running well ahead of budgeted levels , and 20- to 30-percent gains in loan volume from year-ago levels are not uncommon .

Despite these weather-related problems , retailers throughout the district are optimistic about the second quarter . In Minneapolis-St. Paul , retailers expect the usual good spring sales . Besides the normal seasonal pickup , retailers in western areas think they will make up some of the durable goods sales put off by bad first-quarter weather . Consumer demand for housing has remained strong , but because of tighter mortgage terms it may weaken soon . District S & Ls still report a high level of mortgage loan commitments , indicating a sustained demand for housing . However , slower savings inflows reduced the supply of mortgage funds recently . To help offset that slowing , some S & Ls increased their borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board . And , because of the tighter supply of funds and the sustained mortgage demand , most S & Ls raised mortgage interest rates and tightened other mortgage loan terms .

Plant managers , mechanics and mold makers were also cited as specialized skills that were in relative tight supply by one director . For the most part , retail sales in May and early June were judged to have been on target . Nevertheless , for the year as a whole , several merchants felt that sales were below expectations . As a consequence , retailers viewed their inventories as somewhat high , but voiced little concern over their ability to work off any excesses once the summer sales season rolled into gear . Automotive sales have been brisk in recent months . One industry economist attributed the current spurt to a combination of `` catch-up '' buying after the past winter and consumers attempt to beat price increases due on the new model year cars . Thus , he expected sales to taper off considerably later in the summer . Outside of the retail sector , the outlook for capital spending in the District appears to have strengthened . The president of a major utility reported that his firm was experiencing record growth that , in turn , was triggering an increase in capital spending plans . Reports from the directors of the Buffalo branch suggested a noticeable brightening in the outlook . A major Rochester firm has commenced construction of a major facility . At the same time , several manufacturing firms in Buffalo are going ahead with planned plant expansions .

Looking ahead to the next six months , local merchants have widely varying expectations . Although some are fairly optimistic and look for first quarter sales to be as much as 11 percent higher than year-earlier levels , others are more conservative in their projections and expect to simply match early 1978 volume . None of the retailers contacted has assumed a tax cut in his forecast . Local bankers say loan demand remains generally strong this month . Consumer loans continue to grow and C & I loans are reported to be 1 to 7 percent over year-end figures . Business loan demand is slightly ahead of planned levels overall . Bankers contacted say they have seen the underlying demand for business loans grow slowly and steadily over the past several months , so that unconventional loans are less necessary . As for the future , bankers look for continued strength in loan demand over the next two quarters . One contact feels that part of this continuing demand growth will come from the retailing sector .

173,"March 15 , 1978 Retail sales are reported strong in most parts of the District , though the coal strike in Utah and heavy rains in Southern California have weakened sales somewhat . The inventory picture is mixed with some excess inventories reported in Southern California due to rain-depressed sales and thin inventories in the Pacific Northwest due to slow shipments of goods from the Northeast . Western industry continues to grow , with aluminum and aerospace doing particularly well . While consumer and real estate loan demand remains strong , business loan demand is still flat . While retail sales in Northern California appear to be running up to 12 percent above year-ago levels , sales in Southern California have been dampened by unusually heavy and frequent rains . Grocery stores in that area report sales to be both less than last year and less than planned . Retail sales of non-durables in the Los Angeles area are very slow due to bad weather , and year-to-year declines of 10 percent in weekly volumes are not unusual . However , in dry weeks sales activity shoots ahead . This start-stop pattern has made inventory management rather difficult and there are some reports of excess inventories . In the Portland area , retail sales remain strong . One large chain reports January and February sales to be above year-ago levels by 16 and 12 percent respectively .

As construction activity has gained some momentum this spring , shortages of skilled workers and bricklayers are beginning to show up . However , such shortages are not viewed by homebuilders as an insurmountable problem and apprentice programs are bulging . Homebuilders are beginning to express some fear about a sharp decline in home demand in the future . Their special concerns are the possibility of disintermediation , rising mortgage rates , and the continuation of sharply rising costs of building supplies . Builders report that the cost of building materials rose about 15 percent last year . Representatives of some savings and loan associations reported a net outflow of deposits in April . This was said to reflect improved yields on short- and medium-term securities as well as renewed interest in the stock market . Representatives of the savings and loan industry report increased advertising budgets and more offerings of premiums in an attempt to maintain or advance their market share of savings . With strong demand for mortgages , considerable upward pressure has been placed on mortgage interest rates .

Additionally , new Comprehensive Employment Training Act regulations that limit CETA employment to 18 months , effective October 1 , and heavy federal budget cuts will nudge unemployment even higher at a time of anticipated slow economic activity . For example , more than 1,500 CETA workers in Atlanta are expected to be laid off by the end of the year and 182 are scheduled to lose their jobs in East Baton Rouge Parish . After appreciable declines for June and July , attendance at many attractions showed reassuring increases in August . Tourists dealt with higher gasoline prices by continuing to visit attractions within a shorter driving range . Campground business remains very weak throughout the District because of a reluctance to travel too far with gas-guzzling recreational vehicles . Abundant rainfall throughout the District has enhanced yield prospects for crops , particularly soybeans , corn , peanuts , and cotton , and improved pastures . Resultant higher quality pastures helped maintain the good physical condition of cattle herds during the hot summer months .

All three respondents agreed that the moderate third quarter rebound does not signal the end of the recession , although there is disagreement about the appropriate course for monetary policy at the present time . They are puzzled about the recent turmoil in the foreign exchange , gold , and commodity markets , and they offer conflicting advice on how to deal with it . Professor Eckstein believes that the third quarter 's growth was achieved at the cost of a more severe downturn in the months ahead . He expects inflation to continue near its current pace for several more months , however , despite the imminent slowdown . In Eckstein ' s view , the decline of the dollar on foreign exchange markets is primarily the result of domestic economic performance . He cites the high U.S. core inflation rate as one important contributor to the dollar 's weakness . Eckstein is as `` uncertain as everyone else '' about the `` spooky '' international situation , although he is concerned that the weakness of the yen is more damaging to American interests—particularly those of automobile producers—than is the speculation in gold and other commodities .

The strength in auto sales , which was induced by rebates , may have come at the expense of fourth-quarter sales , according to some officials . Durable goods manufacturing has tended to hold up better than had been expected , partly because housing and related industries have been better than expected . However , a supplier to the appliance industry reports that orders have tended to weaken and backlogs reduced in recent weeks . An economist for an aluminum producer views the decline in orders for packaging materials as an indication of a further slowdown . Finally , a retailer believes some softness in overall business sales stems from tight control over inventories , and hence new orders , by retailers . Capital goods producers , except for auto and truck-related industries , report that business has been buoyed by a need for additional facilities , and production is expected to remain strong in the fourth quarter . According to one District economist , high utilization rates and sluggish investment during most of the expansion have made the need for fixed investment apparent . However , a durable goods manufacturer expected businessmen to be cautious because of a lack of funds for investment .

184,"significantly slowed real estate borrowing at District banks . Interim construction loans , for example , remain among the strongest areas of lending activity . High interest rates , however , have slowed mortgage warehousing activity as mortgage bankers face negative spreads between the yields on the mortgages they sell and the rates they must pay for short-term financing . Lending activity at District banks remains strong in most other loan categories , although the rate of growth has ebbed to the slowest pace this year . Loan demands by customers outside the District remain weaker than regional demands . Several bankers have expressed concern over unfair competition from foreign banks . They cite the ability of these banks to undercut prices because of differences in regulation . Preliminary results from our latest survey of agribankers indicate the financial positions of District farmers are much improved from a year ago . The improvement is attributed primarily to larger crop yields and higher grain prices . Although farm loan demand remains strong , bankers report fewer loan extensions and an improved rate of loan repayment over the same period last year .

For the longer term , more of the same is expected . Nine out of 10 manufacturers are projecting higher inputs costs six months out , and 3 out of 4 are planning to boost the prices of the goods they sell . Third District retailers report some growth in sales in September , but not enough to yield an increase after adjusting for inflation . Reports of current sales levels range from 3 to 6 percent over year- ago figures—about as expected on average . Merchants point to higher outlays by consumers for gasoline and an overall lack of confidence in the economy as factors that are keeping a lid on sales at this point . Retail inventories are in basically good shape despite the apparent sluggishness , a direct result of cautious planning in earlier months . Looking ahead to the first quarter of 1980 , local merchants are generally pretty cautious .

While department store sales continue strong , auto sales have declined in most areas of the District . A decline in residential construction is being partially offset by an increase in commercial construction . Labor shortages have emerged in a number of areas . Loan demand is weakening in some areas , though non-real estate loan demand appears to continue strong in many parts of the District . While there is little information available on post-Christmas sales , the Christmas season itself was characterized by strong and sometimes unexpectedly strong growth in department store sales . One Oregon department store noted a 15-20 percent increase in December sales over last year . Merchants in two Washington counties reported record Christmas sales , some exceeding last year by 25 percent . While other areas reported similarly strong sales , at least one observer noted that merchants were approaching 1979 with caution and keeping a sharp eye on inventories .

198,"August 5 , 1980 The economy of the Eleventh District continues to expand slowly in the current recession . A survey of department stores showed little improvement in unit sales , while sales of new cars have picked up slightly from their previously very depressed levels . Some pickup in speculative residential building is underway , and nonresidential construction continues its relatively strong pace . Lending at most S & L 's and commercial banks is showing slight response to declining interest rates . Manufacturing output is soft , with some improvement in orders from suppliers to the construction industry . Drought conditions are having substantial impact on agricultural production in the District . Unit sales at department stores throughout most of the District remain lackluster , although stores in the Houston and Austin areas report increases from last year 's levels . Credit sales are rebounding from the low level following March 14 but remains a smaller proportion of total sales than in the previous year . Department stores continue to rely heavily on sales and promotions to generate store traffic and move merchandise .

Bankers report many inquiries for terms on auto loans , but most are reluctant to borrow at the prevailing 14.5- percent annual rate . The decline in interest rates has reduced inventory costs for dealers , but weak sales forced the bankruptcy of a major Dallas Ford dealer last month . The outlook for residential construction has improved slightly . Inventories of unsold new homes are not excessive . Sales of both new and used homes have picked up slightly in the last two months with the decline in mortgage rates and increased availability of municipal bond funding in the District . Corporate relocations to this area also continue to bolster sales . However , the revival in home sales is not yet significant , as some home purchases are being delayed as many potential buyers anticipate further declines in mortgage rates . Prices are reported to be firm , with substantial discounts generally not available . Liquidity positions of most S & L 's in the District are much improved with a net Inflow of savings deposits and the low rate of forward commitments on mortgage loans . Mortgage demands are not as great as expected as many potential home buyers are waiting for further declines in rates .

201,"some improvement . The farm sector is still suffering from the drought . Some of the district 's crops and grazing lands have been irreversibly damaged by the hot , dry weather . North Dakota farmers , for example , are expected to harvest only 15 bushels of durum wheat per acre , about half as much as last year . The district 's corn and soybean crops , however , could still be quite good if they get adequate moisture in August . In spite of the drought , farm income in the district has stopped falling . This is mainly because the prices that farmers are getting for their products leaped between June and July . In Minneapolis , for instance , average cash prices ( per bushel ) increased from $ 2.52 to $ 2.82 for corn , from $ 4.19 to $ 4.55 for wheat , and from $ 5.95 to $ 6.94 for soybeans . Farm income was also buoyed in July by the administration 's increased price supports for these products . ... Freer Spending , Fewer Layoffs ... District consumers seen to have started to recover in July , too .

202,"March 11 , 1980 The REDBOOK reports this month indicate that business activity is holding quite steady in most districts , with few widespread signs of weakness . High technology and defense-related industries are performing particularly well . The major exceptions to this pattern are the housing and automobile industries , which are exhibiting considerable weakness . Most districts report very strong volumes of retail sales—a phenomenon which several reports ascribed to a pervasive `` spend it now '' psychology on the part of consumers . Reports of continued inflation are also widespread . With the exception of home mortgages , loan volumes were reported to be strong in most districts prior to the recent runup in rates . Spotty current reports indicate a subsequent weakening of loan demand . Financial institutions are experiencing considerable conversion of savings deposits into money-market liabilities , and there is widespread concern about the consequent effect on the cost of funds and institutional profitability . The agricultural sector is apparently in good shape in most districts . Most districts report generally strong industrial activity . New York , for example , reports brisk new orders and generally steady activity . Minneapolis finds industrial output and employment expanding ; manufacturing employment is up 14 percent from a year ago . Dallas finds continued , but slowing , growth in manufacturing .

Activity related to high-technology , defense and energy-saving products is reported to be particularly vigorous by Boston , New York and San Francisco .

Two-thirds of our respondents report sales down over the past month and all respondents report a relative decline in big ticket items .

Despite an overall decline in the level of retail inventories a large majority of respondents now feel that stocks are too high .

Twenty percent report no change in prices paid . Among retail respondents prices received and paid , on average , showed little or no change over the month . Respondents ' expectations of future activity , however , deteriorated sharply over the past month . Over 90 percent of the manufacturing respondents now expect the level of business activity nationally to worsen over the next six months , and a majority expect a decline in their respective market areas .

Manufacturers ' new orders continued to weaken slightly over the past month and order backlogs were further reduced , but shipments were somewhat higher and inventories were generally larger than in January . Still , fewer than a third of our respondents find current stocks excessive . Retail sales seem to have advanced in the past month despite some softening in big ticket lines . Inventories at the retail level are essentially unchanged and are generally in line with desired levels . It appears that aggregate credit demand in the District is holding steady , but its composition is changing . Business loan demand is now the primary source of overall strength . Installment loan demand is sagging while mortgage lending practices have tightened considerably . Recent snowstorms inflicted substantial and lasting damage on poultry producing operations in parts of the District . In the manufacturing sector new orders remain soft and order backlogs continue to be worked down ; on the other hand , both shipments and inventories were up somewhat in the past month .

205,"December 16 , 1981 Manufacturing in the First District has weakened over the past month and a half . Many more firms than usual have announced shutdowns over the Christmas season . The retail situation is more difficult to assess ; since Thanksgiving , sales have been strong in some areas , weak in others . Also , last year the Christmas season began slowly but ended on a strong note and the season as a whole was quite good ; it is impossible to tell yet if this is happening again . Retailers are somewhat concerned about inventory levels ; most manufacturers , despite the recent downturn , do not view inventories as a problem . The housing market remains weak , but mortgage rates are now beginning to fall . Until Thanksgiving , New England retail sales in November continued to reflect the weakening economy . As a result , inventories are higher than planned . Since Thanksgiving , retailing has been very mixed . Some areas are showing unexpected strength , and in others , sales have fallen well below the usual seasonal levels . The picture in Massachusetts is complicated by a heavy weekend snowstorm that closed most stores for a day . One merchant cites particular strength in sales of high quality goods , partly a result of that firm 's efforts to attract more high income customers and partly because the recession is affecting high income shoppers less . This is consistent with sales reports showing greater weakness for discount",-0.5,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:41:16.6307468Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": -0.5\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 32146, 220, 16, 21, 1154, 220, 16, 24, 23, 16, 41077, 304, 279, 5512, 10942, 702, 57664, 916, 279, 3267, 2254, 323, 264, 4279, 659, 8999, 803, 18809, 1091, 13475, 614, 7228, 23766, 82, 916, 279, 10074, 3200, 659, 576, 10806, 6534, 374, 803, 5000, 311, 8552, 2587, 2474, 36150, 1154, 6625, 614, 1012, 3746, 304, 1045, 5671, 1154, 7469, 304, 3800, 659, 7281, 1154, 1537, 1042, 279, 10074, 3200, 6009, 13970, 714, 9482, 389, 264, 3746, 5185, 323, 279, 3200, 438, 264, 4361, 572, 5008, 1661, 2587, 432, 374, 11997, 311, 3291, 3602, 421, 419, 374, 12482, 1549, 659, 34039, 388, 525, 14400, 11658, 911, 15444, 5866, 2587, 1429, 16621, 1154, 8818, 279, 3213, 75406, 1154, 653, 537, 1651, 17023, 2433, 438, 264, 3491, 659, 576, 11721, 3081, 8458, 7469, 1154, 714, 20846, 7813, 525, 1431, 7167, 311, 4399, 659, 28970, 36150, 1154, 1532, 9448, 10806, 6625, 304, 6702, 8570, 311, 8708, 279, 82426, 8584, 659, 1634, 264, 1102, 1154, 17023, 2433, 525, 5080, 1091, 12909, 659, 8704, 36150, 1154, 10806, 287, 702, 1012, 1602, 9519, 659, 4329, 5671, 525, 9027, 16500, 8170, 1154, 323, 304, 3800, 1154, 6625, 614, 20866, 1632, 3685, 279, 13475, 35799, 5866, 659, 576, 6802, 304, 21393, 374, 16965, 553, 264, 8811, 9001, 11794, 26413, 429, 7877, 1429, 10533, 369, 264, 1899, 659, 3776, 29238, 57173, 3953, 8170, 304, 6625, 315, 1550, 4271, 11561, 1154, 27037, 264, 1102, 315, 429, 7474, 364, 82, 8869, 311, 9320, 803, 1550, 7911, 6310, 323, 27037, 1576, 279, 38521, 374, 27887, 1550, 7911, 48735, 2686, 659, 1096, 374, 12966, 448, 6625, 6682, 9027, 7046, 23078, 369, 11089, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 481, 15, 13, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3470551400, 'load_duration': 12130800, 'prompt_eval_count': 323, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1005080000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2450660000}"
206,"ahead to 1982 , the executives were almost unanimous in forecasting an improved year at home but only half expected an upturn abroad . One positive development in this month 's reports is evidence of further progress in bringing down the rate of inflation . Only a third of purchasing managers surveyed reported prices increased in the past month ; earlier in the year and for most of 1980 , two-thirds normally reported higher prices . Commodity prices have softened and are expected to remain soft for some time . Not everyone is happy about lower prices : the building materials executive reports that although costs are up , his firm has been forced to price its products below 1980 levels . Professors Houthakker and Samuelson were available for comment this month . Houthakker is disappointed that fiscal policy for 1982 will not reduce the budget deficit , and he sympathizes somewhat with our foreign trading partners who object to domestic policies . Nevertheless , he believes there is no need to change monetary policy at this time . Houthakker recommends a temporary shift of attention to M-2 if a conflict should arise between attaining the M-2 guideline and the M-1B guideline . Once the NOW account adjustment is complete and the M-2 and M-1B guidelines are once again mutually consistent , the Fed should return its attention to M-1B . Houthakker wonders how much of recent M-2 growth is due to the increase in money market mutual fund balances .

207,"January 28 , 1981 Economic activity in the First District is largely unchanged since the last Redbook report , and most respondents do not foresee major changes for either better or worse in the next several months . Retailers are generally satisfied with Christmas sales . Final reports are not yet in but the consensus is that sales were late but fairly good . Among manufacturers there is a suggestion of a slight weakening since November ; some of the smaller high technology companies are starting to see declines in orders . The well publicized shortage of natural gas in Massachusetts has passed ; it does not appear to have had a major impact on business activity . Retailers report that Christmas sales were vigorous , particularly in the final days . However , it will not be possible to know whether the 1980 season was profitable until final inventories are completed . Although the volume figures are encouraging , sales and markdowns were widespread . Retail inventories are under control with the possible exception of some consumer durables .

Overall manufacturing activity , as measured by the Fourth District 's Survey of Manufacturing , is expected to continue to expand into the second quarter , based on strength in new orders , shipments and employment . However , a loss of momentum is also suggested by the reduction in the number of firms expecting increases in each of these indexes , except shipments , during April . Prices Moderation in the first quarter GNP implicit price deflator has not altered inflation expectations . Decelerating prices , anticipated by several Roundtable economists , have been enhanced by rebate programs in the auto industry and declining demand for gasoline . While most items except energy increased at a reduced rate in the first quarter of 1981 , the underlying inflation rate remains about 9 % -10 % , according to an auto economist . A producer of consumer nondurables expects meat prices to increase during the summer , following the stepped-up slaughtering of cattle in recent weeks . Food prices in general may be helped by expected good weather , but rising costs could lead to upward pressures on prices by year-end . A trade economist expects inflation to move below double-digit rates by the end of the year , but he also expects slower progress over the longer term because of the insensitivity of wage costs .

212,"January 28 , 1981 Overview Business conditions in the Tenth District continue to show little strength . Softness in retail sales is expected to continue for a while , and the short-term outlook for auto sales is viewed as poor . Inventories of retailers and manufacturers are higher than desired . The winter wheat crop is in some danger due to lack of moisture . Loan demand at commercial banks has weakened recently , with loans to the energy industry an exception . Retail Sales and Inventories Most Tenth District retailers indicate that total dollar sales in 1980 were 5-10 per cent greater than in 1979 . But sales in December 1980 and January 1981 have not shown that much strength in most areas of the District . Sales have been strongest in durable goods and higher priced items , primarily quality apparel . Most retailers expect the current softness of total sales to continue , at least through the first and second quarters . A majority of retailers continue to report negligible merchandise cost increases in recent months are reducing upward pressure on retail prices . Most retailers note recent downward pressure on profit margins because of increases in advertising expenditures , utility bills , and other operational expenses . The recent weakness in total dollar sales leaves most retailers in the Tenth District with inventory levels that are slightly higher than desirable . However , none of the retailers report any plans for extra clearance sales in January or February .

213,"sluggishness in various sectors of the district economy has recently been complicated by strikes . The district , like the rest of the country , is experiencing slower deliveries and less travel- related business because of the air traffic controllers ' strike . The district is also being adversely affected by several other labor disputes . Since mid-July , 14,000 State of Minnesota workers have been on strike , reducing state services . In addition , labor disputes between residential builders and carpenters and between foundries and workers have been slowing down construction and manufacturing activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area . Financial Activity The sluggishness in the district 's economy is manifested in weak bank lending . Loans at Minneapolis-St. Paul area banks in June and July were essentially unchanged from their lackluster level this past spring .

New orders for capital goods continued to taper off . The strength of the dollar is worrying exporters , but so far few specific comments on export sales losses have been picked up . The overall economic outlook is mixed . While personal tax cuts are expected to boost department store sales by the end of 1981 , automobile sales and capital spending are expected to remain weak until interest rates fall significantly . On the financial side , major banks reported substantial increases in levels of credit lines intended for merger activity . Consumer Spending In July , retail activity in the Second District fell from the generally high levels of May and June . While several department store chains indicated that sales were at or above plan , performances at all retail stores were weaker than those of last month . Sales in the New York City stores were slower than in their suburban counterparts , in contrast to previous months when no geographic pattern emerged : The slackening in the overall sales pace has caused no change in plans , as respondents speculated that seasonal factors and the timing of holiday promotions were partly responsible .

222,"large iron mining company recalled about 1,800 workers in early March , another laid off 2,100 workers for eight weeks . Besides that , energy production , which had long been a source of strength for the district , weakened recently . Due to the glut in petroleum supplies , oil exploration slowed at the western end of the district . A Montana director said that in early March 100 oil rigs were idle in eastern Montana and western North Dakota . Directors also said that the forest products industry at both ends of the district remained very depressed . Agricultural Conditions Recent changes in the prices of farm products indicate possible recovery for about half the district 's farmers—those who produce livestock—but not for the other half . Between January and early March , the prices farmers receive for hogs and cattle at South St. Paul rose about 7 percent . One director attributed part of the rise to unusually harsh winter weather restricting the flow of livestock to market . But the price rise may not be as temporary as that explanation would indicate : an economist associated with the livestock industry attributed part of the rise to livestock herds being smaller than anticipated . Crop farmers have n't had to face this ambiguity about their price situation . Cash crop prices at Minneapolis were essentially unchanged between January and early March , and they were considerably below their year-earlier levels . Weak demand seemed to be keeping these prices down , for the",-0.5,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:42:14.229684Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": -0.5\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 16767, 11001, 11673, 2813, 31130, 911, 220, 16, 11, 23, 15, 15, 7337, 304, 4124, 5470, 1154, 2441, 17113, 1007, 220, 17, 11, 16, 15, 15, 7337, 369, 8063, 5555, 659, 30809, 429, 1154, 4802, 5670, 1154, 892, 1030, 1293, 1012, 264, 2530, 315, 8170, 369, 279, 9290, 1154, 57664, 5926, 659, 23662, 311, 279, 34069, 304, 58963, 16720, 1154, 5590, 26403, 47846, 518, 279, 18494, 835, 315, 279, 9290, 659, 362, 36005, 7538, 1053, 429, 304, 4124, 5470, 220, 16, 15, 15, 5590, 95051, 1033, 27647, 304, 23149, 36005, 323, 18494, 4787, 27872, 659, 44985, 1083, 1053, 429, 279, 13638, 3871, 4958, 518, 2176, 10335, 315, 279, 9290, 14616, 1602, 41542, 659, 59034, 31834, 34290, 4344, 304, 279, 7576, 315, 8785, 3871, 13216, 3204, 13351, 369, 911, 4279, 279, 9290, 364, 82, 20336, 2293, 53619, 879, 8193, 50776, 37442, 537, 369, 279, 1008, 4279, 659, 27133, 6058, 323, 4124, 5470, 1154, 279, 7576, 20336, 5258, 369, 305, 26307, 323, 35852, 518, 4882, 794, 13, 6898, 16009, 911, 220, 22, 3266, 659, 3776, 7538, 29606, 949, 315, 279, 10000, 311, 56799, 24939, 12406, 9104, 64851, 279, 6396, 315, 50776, 311, 3081, 659, 1988, 279, 3349, 10000, 1231, 537, 387, 438, 13340, 438, 429, 16148, 1035, 13216, 549, 458, 45115, 5815, 448, 279, 50776, 4958, 29606, 949, 315, 279, 10000, 311, 50776, 1059, 5356, 1660, 9155, 1091, 29099, 659, 67320, 20336, 614, 308, 944, 1030, 311, 3579, 419, 71768, 911, 862, 3349, 6534, 659, 22338, 19097, 7576, 518, 41858, 1033, 15791, 34857, 1948, 6058, 323, 4124, 5470, 1154, 323, 807, 1033, 32352, 3685, 862, 1042, 12, 682, 5623, 5866, 659, 41164, 7479, 9324, 311, 387, 10282, 1493, 7576, 1495, 1154, 369, 279, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 1, 24512, 3819, 788, 481, 15, 13, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3261529000, 'load_duration': 15402500, 'prompt_eval_count': 335, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1012318000, 'eval_count': 12, 'eval_duration': 2230710000}"
223,"December 15 , 1982 Overview Economic activity in most Districts showed some signs of improvement except in the manufacturing sector . Weakness in manufacturing remained pervasive with some further layoffs reported and , for the most part , little or no upturn in new orders . Consumer spending strengthened in November but several Districts noted sluggish early-December sales . Housing sales and starts registered gains in most regions although the oversupply of office space kept nonresidential construction generally slow . In several agricultural areas a further decline in farm income and land values overshadowed the few bright spots that appeared . Commercial bank lending was essentially flat in most reporting Districts . The general outlook ranges from a slight upturn during the next six months to little pickup until late 1983 . Consumer Spending Since the last report , consumer expenditures posted some gains on both a month-to-month and year-over-year basis , helped in part by promotional activity . Nonetheless , no real exuberance was displayed . Auto sales picked up in several areas in response to lower finance charges but these lower rates are scheduled to end soon . With regard to the overall outlook for retail sales during the holiday season , the most optimistic report was from Boston ( `` solid but unspectacular '' ) . Several Districts experienced good consumer buying immediately after Thanksgiving but sluggish sales thereafter .

One factor cited was the trend in recent years of a shift in sales to the end of the holiday season .

224,"will not support a strong and sustained business recovery . Business liquidity continues to deteriorate ; profits will remain under extreme pressure , while no balance sheet restructuring has materialized during this recession . Many additional downgradings of business credit ratings are likely to be announced in the forthcoming months . Interest rates will continue to be highly volatile . The long-term bond markets in particular will be challenged by a lack of liquidity in business , the huge Treasury cash needs , and a firm monetary policy . Maude : Most likely developments over the spring and early summer months should place renewed severe upward pressure on interest rates with long-term yields retesting their 1981 highs in a financial crisis type environment . These developments should manifest themselves in the form of a highly anemic economic recovery , some modest pick-up in private credit demands , a cash flow squeeze in the nonfinancial corporate sector , continued strains on financial intermediaries , credit quality concerns and a reluctance on the part of investors to make long-term fixed income commitments . The underlying causes of these difficulties should be an April and July surge in money growth , a resulting monetary tightening , huge actual Treasury financing ( especially during the third quarter ) and continued apprehension over the out-year budgetary deficits .

Stone : It is our view that the economy has probably touched bottom and that a few months of relatively slow growth lies ahead .

By the end of 1982 , the number of new residential permits issued in Utah will have fallen by 70 percent from the 1977 all-time high , making this housing recession the longest and most severe on record . New permits in Oregon so far this year are at less than a tenth of 1979 levels . The nonresidential construction picture is mixed . In Oregon , this activity dropped 30 percent in August from July . In Los Angeles , nonresidential construction has slowed down ; some projects have been canceled , including a few that were underway , because long-term financing could not be found .

Time deposits and jumbo CDs contributed the largest shares to September 's deposit gains at banks . In contrast , loan activity at large southeastern banks slowed significantly in September after advancing throughout the summer . Business lending , which failed to register a gain from August to September , was the primary source of this deceleration . However , consumer lending increased in September for the seventh consecutive month . A money center bank is backing Florida legislation to allow out-of- state financial institutions to establish de novo operations in the state , thereby permitting out-of-state banks to enter the market without acquiring existing institutions . The proposal is a response to a legislative initiative by Florida bankers to limit out-of-state banking to institutions from regional states with similar reciprocal agreements . Tourism The industry is entering its traditionally slow fall season after a summer that proved to be generally positive , except in south Florida , middle and east Tennessee , and New Orleans . Hotels and motels increased revenues in August even though occupancy levels were below comparable 1982 levels in many District cities .

Proponents of the Florida legislation maintained that interstate banking would provide more capital for loans , expand the state 's tax base , and create some healthy competition . Although tabled , the Florida bill could come up later this year . Advocates of the Tennessee legislation argued that out-of-state acquisition of some local banks would relieve the lack of confidence in the state 's financial industry caused by the failure of United American Bank ( UAB ) .

Banks in the District generally have not been aggressive about the new deregulated time deposits and hence have not experienced much shifting of deposits and have not attracted new deposits .",0.2,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:43:02.7501226Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.2\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 21152, 311, 4583, 279, 1973, 70722, 40065, 419, 3267, 12252, 659, 87872, 1087, 7035, 279, 6122, 17704, 304, 6625, 311, 1550, 20846, 7813, 659, 576, 1172, 9906, 7702, 304, 279, 11721, 10486, 1154, 4092, 311, 48086, 323, 1931, 97166, 1154, 374, 458, 5263, 304, 9442, 2293, 83698, 22630, 1959, 8206, 6009, 3143, 279, 835, 315, 6122, 1154, 323, 892, 1231, 9583, 1102, 304, 5042, 10163, 323, 6625, 659, 30526, 6572, 7813, 304, 8353, 13702, 7146, 9016, 1550, 448, 56954, 58475, 389, 458, 12944, 2205, 8584, 659, 17715, 419, 1550, 61462, 4379, 1154, 8086, 374, 14354, 389, 3807, 5163, 4752, 7079, 6814, 279, 10942, 659, 27843, 49499, 37766, 304, 279, 35074, 10942, 11046, 862, 57248, 315, 547, 808, 13, 31891, 33819, 1154, 1584, 323, 2205, 3033, 33819, 323, 6775, 10514, 304, 3213, 5555, 659, 1527, 5263, 304, 11679, 7479, 1154, 304, 31446, 448, 264, 12864, 73917, 304, 16539, 6513, 1154, 1231, 10339, 279, 13951, 304, 6073, 21786, 659, 47775, 1832, 678, 315, 279, 5263, 304, 11679, 8123, 518, 9290, 13959, 572, 304, 279, 8353, 323, 12785, 11679, 5582, 659, 2009, 11059, 315, 33651, 1033, 15791, 10063, 659, 37766, 304, 279, 10942, 8789, 614, 537, 1012, 19188, 911, 279, 501, 71815, 7757, 882, 33651, 323, 16085, 614, 537, 10321, 1753, 31831, 315, 33651, 323, 614, 537, 28023, 501, 33651, 659, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 17, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3404883800, 'load_duration': 13653900, 'prompt_eval_count': 272, 'prompt_eval_duration': 936675000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2451702000}"

Employment , hours worked , shipments , new orders , and order backlogs are flat . Inventories continue to fall and about 20 % of firms report increases in prices they pay for materials , components , and services . A survey of purchasing managers in the Cincinnati area indicates a steady slowing in April and May in the rate of gain in production , new orders , and order backlogs . Inventories of raw materials and finished goods are falling . Firms report a decline in employment in May after two months of increases . Manufacturing of light trucks and automobiles , especially large autos , is strong . Producers of these vehicles and their components report expanding hours and employment , but remain cautious about building inventories . Production of parts for the auto after-market , which remained fairly steady during the recession , is rising slowly . Tire manufacturing is improving mildly . Tire manufacturers report shipments of original equipment auto tires up substantially over last year in line with improved new car sales , while replacement tire shipments are up only slightly . Production is up only moderately over last year because original equipment sales account for only a small share of the business . Manufacturers have stopped inventory drawdown but are taking a cautious approach to inventory building .

243,"February 2 , 1983 Overview Business firms in the Tenth District are expecting a slow recovery to get underway during the second or third quarter of 1983 . Recent stable prices are expected to rise slightly as 1983 moves along . Inventories are generally lean and are likely to remain so in the near future . Farmers and agricultural lenders are somewhat more optimistic about conditions in the agricultural sector , due partly to the expected response to the newly announced farm program . Loan demand at commercial banks is generally flat , while deposit growth is up because of strong growth in the new money market deposit accounts . Retail Trade All respondents indicate that nominal sales for 1982 as a whole were slightly higher ( 5 percent or less ) than those in 1981 . Sales in the final quarter of 1982 were between 5 and 10 percent higher than a year earlier . The strength in retail sales has come mainly in soft goods , with big-ticket items still very weak . Prices , which were stable during the last three months of 1982 , are expected to remain stable or rise slightly in 1983 . Retailers seem to be generally satisfied with the low level of their inventories . They expect sales to be sluggish in the first half of 1983 and to improve slowly after that . Purchasing Agents All purchasing agents report that prices of a wide range of materials inputs ( e.g. , steel , aluminum , rubber ,",0.2,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:43:26.4705588Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": 0.2\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 32777, 220, 17, 1154, 220, 16, 24, 23, 18, 34807, 8025, 18809, 304, 279, 350, 20684, 10942, 525, 22331, 264, 6301, 13351, 311, 633, 37099, 2337, 279, 2086, 476, 4843, 8338, 315, 220, 16, 24, 23, 18, 659, 34290, 15175, 7576, 525, 3601, 311, 10000, 10078, 438, 220, 16, 24, 23, 18, 10797, 3156, 659, 92158, 2433, 525, 8789, 15651, 323, 525, 4363, 311, 7146, 773, 304, 279, 3143, 3853, 659, 62322, 323, 28049, 45015, 525, 14400, 803, 35936, 911, 4682, 304, 279, 28049, 10486, 1154, 4152, 27037, 311, 279, 3601, 2033, 311, 279, 13631, 7228, 8785, 2025, 659, 35081, 7479, 518, 8353, 13959, 374, 8789, 10063, 1154, 1393, 16539, 6513, 374, 705, 1576, 315, 3746, 6513, 304, 279, 501, 3220, 3081, 16539, 9618, 659, 34039, 17214, 2009, 33181, 13216, 429, 46755, 6625, 369, 220, 16, 24, 23, 17, 438, 264, 4361, 1033, 10078, 5080, 320, 220, 20, 3266, 476, 2686, 873, 1091, 1846, 304, 220, 16, 24, 23, 16, 659, 15829, 304, 279, 1590, 8338, 315, 220, 16, 24, 23, 17, 1033, 1948, 220, 20, 323, 220, 16, 15, 3266, 5080, 1091, 264, 1042, 6788, 659, 576, 8170, 304, 10806, 6625, 702, 2525, 14576, 304, 8413, 11561, 1154, 448, 2409, 93222, 3589, 2058, 1602, 7469, 659, 36033, 1154, 892, 1033, 15175, 2337, 279, 1537, 2326, 3951, 315, 220, 16, 24, 23, 17, 1154, 525, 3601, 311, 7146, 15175, 476, 10000, 10078, 304, 220, 16, 24, 23, 18, 659, 34039, 388, 2803, 311, 387, 8789, 19527, 448, 279, 3347, 2188, 315, 862, 17023, 2433, 659, 2379, 1720, 6625, 311, 387, 86946, 304, 279, 1156, 4279, 315, 220, 16, 24, 23, 18, 323, 311, 7269, 13970, 1283, 429, 659, 52692, 4422, 50254, 2009, 22577, 13009, 1895, 429, 7576, 315, 264, 6884, 2088, 315, 7236, 11127, 320, 384, 1302, 13, 1154, 9509, 1154, 24649, 1154, 22674, 1154, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 1, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 17, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3276593700, 'load_duration': 13070800, 'prompt_eval_count': 359, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1079176000, 'eval_count': 12, 'eval_duration': 2181068000}"

245,"activity has been `` unexpectedly quiet '' since early August . Current reports on business loan volume range from 11 percent below to 14 percent above a year ago , much the same as they were six weeks ago . According to contacts , increased corporate profits have sufficiently improved cash flow at many companies , permitting more internal financing and preventing any real firming of commercial loan demand . Loan activity on the retail side continues to improve , but recent gains are not as strong as earlier in the year . Although consumer lending is now as much as 11 percent ahead of last September , lenders say rising interest rates have taken some of the edge off the demand for consumer loans . Area banking officials foresee gradual improvement in overall lending activity over the next six months . C & I loan demand is expected to gain strength slowly through next March as commercial investment expands beyond the funds available internally . Most bankers also predict that consumer demand for credit will expand further despite the likelihood of slightly higher interest rates .

251,"December 5 , 1984 Summary Total business activity in the Seventh District has been about stable since early this year , having flattened earlier than in the nation . Most District reports suggest relative stability in the months ahead , but concern has been growing that a general deterioration is underway . Auto production has returned to a high level , but only slightly above last year . Steel output has improved since late September , but remains well below the first half rate , and below break-even levels . Machine tool orders are up , mainly from the auto industry . Heavy construction and farm equipment makers , faced with weak markets , are selling off units and closing marginal plants . Cutbacks are occurring in the important health care industry , reversing a long-term expansion . Container loadings on flat cars , which had slowed earlier in the year , slipped significantly in November . Demand for most mechanical capital equipment remains weak . Sales of heavy trucks and trailers have softened recently from high levels . However , surveys show sizable additions to capital outlays next year by the auto and steel industries . Many lines of seasonal retail merchandise are reported moving well , but the 2-year boom in consumer hardgoods apparently has run its course . Retail inventories are viewed as excessive , encouraging price markdowns . Recent declines in paperboard demand partly reflect reduced orders for general merchandise .

Recession Fears The plateau in District activity since last spring , coupled with recent declines in factory orders and freight movements , raises the question of an imminent recession . Pressures to reduce or hold down inventories are intense . Our contacts with industries important in the District generally expect relative stability during the rest of 1984 and early 1985—but no precipitous decline . However , some company analysts are warning their managements that the situation is fragile and that a general decline , rather than renewed expansion , is the more likely development . Motor Vehicles Auto makers are planning production at a high level through next year 's first quarter , but with only small gains from year-earlier levels . Weaker auto sales in recent months reflect shortages of popular models . Strikes , unrelated parts shortages , and import quotas have limited supplies . Large `` availability '' premiums are reported on some models , recalling the situation after World War II . Steel Steel production in the Chicago and Detroit areas has improved somewhat from September lows associated with heavy imports , the auto strike , and inventory cutting . However , output remains well below the first half pace . Increasingly . imports have penetrated Midwest markets . usually through steel service centers , often owned by foreign steel producers .

255,"October 23 , 1984 Overview Some moderation continues to be apparent in Tenth District economic activity . While retail sales continue to improve , housing activity and mortgage demand have generally slowed . Inventories of retail goods are slightly larger than desired , while inventories of materials inputs are at satisfactory levels . Price increases have been small , and are expected to continue so . Loan demand is increasing slightly at district banks , while deposits remain unchanged . Yields of fall-harvested crops varied across the district while the newly-planted winter wheat crop is in good condition . Retail Trade Retailers report that year-to-date retail sales are up significantly over a year ago , and that sales continued to improve in the past three months . Inventories are slightly larger than desired for some retailers . However , no major trimming is intended , because most retailers are optimistic about sales through the remainder of the year . Prices remained generally flat in recent months , and no significant increases are anticipated through the remainder of the year . Automobile Sales Automobile dealers throughout the Tenth District continue to report improved sales in 1984 relative to last year . Credit market conditions are satisfactory , and financing is available both for floorplanning and car buyers . Most dealers report smaller inventories due mainly to the 1985 model introductions and partially to the GM strike .

Dealers are optimistic about sales for the balance of 1984 and early 1985 .

258,"nut and grape acreage in the San Joaquin Valley area of California . Financial Institutions In August , consumer credit ( not seasonally adjusted ) at large banks in the Twelfth District grew at a 24 percent annual rate . This represented the largest monthly increase in 1984 and offset weakness in commercial and real estate lending . A sample of smaller institutions showed similar behavior . These increases continue the pattern of strong consumer loan growth shown earlier this year . Bankers in the region attribute the strength to improved economic conditions which have boosted consumer purchases of new cars and recreational vehicles . While a number of banks also report strength in home equity loans , others have experienced slow to flat demand for those loans as consumers have shifted to use of personal credit lines and credit cards for financing . The forecast for consumer credit remains mixed . Many banks expect these loans to continue to grow rapidly through year-end . However , an even larger number of institutions expect slower growth in personal income and rising interest rates to cause a slowdown in both consumer spending and borrowing . A few of these already have experienced a falloff in consumer loan demand .",0.5,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:44:17.5572434Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.5\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 23333, 323, 51152, 45223, 424, 304, 279, 5836, 10946, 64, 35344, 13046, 3082, 315, 7043, 659, 17503, 87780, 758, 6156, 1154, 11502, 6668, 320, 537, 3200, 745, 23368, 873, 518, 3460, 13959, 304, 279, 11753, 87698, 10942, 13938, 518, 264, 220, 17, 19, 3266, 9775, 4379, 659, 1096, 15251, 279, 7772, 15088, 5263, 304, 220, 16, 24, 23, 19, 323, 4347, 23078, 304, 8353, 323, 1931, 12394, 39551, 659, 362, 6077, 315, 9155, 14336, 8542, 4428, 7709, 659, 4220, 12703, 3060, 279, 5383, 315, 3746, 11502, 11679, 6513, 6839, 6788, 419, 1042, 659, 8547, 388, 304, 279, 5537, 7035, 279, 8170, 311, 12944, 6955, 4682, 892, 614, 64108, 11502, 23491, 315, 501, 9331, 323, 36000, 11474, 659, 5976, 264, 1372, 315, 13959, 1083, 1895, 8170, 304, 2114, 24448, 16606, 1154, 3800, 614, 10321, 6301, 311, 10063, 7479, 369, 1846, 16606, 438, 13417, 614, 28973, 311, 990, 315, 4345, 6668, 5128, 323, 6668, 7411, 369, 28542, 659, 576, 17595, 369, 11502, 6668, 8458, 9519, 659, 8999, 13959, 1720, 1493, 16606, 311, 3060, 311, 3063, 18512, 1526, 1042, 13068, 659, 4354, 1154, 458, 1496, 8131, 1372, 315, 14336, 1720, 28393, 6513, 304, 4345, 7911, 323, 16062, 2734, 7813, 311, 5240, 264, 73917, 304, 2176, 11502, 10164, 323, 52575, 659, 362, 2421, 315, 1493, 2669, 614, 10321, 264, 25484, 93038, 304, 11502, 11679, 7479, 659, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3321100700, 'load_duration': 13134200, 'prompt_eval_count': 276, 'prompt_eval_duration': 934824000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2370430000}"
259,"October 23 , 1984 Consumer spending continued at a brisk pace during September and early October in the Eighth District , but home sales were down and most other sectors of the economy experienced little change . Expectations by most respondents are that consumer spending will remain strong for the remainder of the year and that manufacturing , transportation and employment will rise moderately , while construction is likely to drift lower . Consumer Spending The greatest strength in District economic activity during September and early October was in retail sales . At six department stores , sales were 8 percent higher than the comparable period a year ago , which was then considered a relatively good sales period . Better quality apparel , sports wear , cosmetics and consumer electronics moved particularly well , while sales of furniture and carpeting were below year-ago levels . At each of three discount stores , sales increases were more than 14 percent above the year-ago pace . Promotions combined with price markdowns were successful in moving merchandise . Auto demand remained strong in most parts of the District during September and early October . In the last week of September , however , sales became somewhat sluggish . Seven dealers reported sales 11 percent higher in September than in the same month a year ago , and early October was nearly as good .

Reflecting the strong demand and a continued shortage of popular models , effective new car prices increased at the retail level .

264,"May 6 , 1985 Economic activity has slowed in the First District in recent months . The slowdown has occurred in both the manufacturing and retail sectors , but some individual firms continue to show substantial growth . Retailers ' sales fell below plan in some cases but continue to exceed last year 's levels . In manufacturing , the national slowdown in office equipment and computers has been well publicized , and New England 's high tech firms have been among those experiencing difficulty . The region 's traditional industries report mixed results , but remain optimistic about 1985 . Retail Retail sales have slowed recently in the First District . The weakening is not universal , however , hitting some `` upscale '' department stores for example , but not a discount chain , and showing wide geographic variation . The downturn is not substantial , and merchants remain moderately optimistic about 1985 . The shift of Easter from April last year to March this year complicates the interpretation of spring sales figures , but March was not an exceptional month for New England retailers . Apparel and other soft goods—traditional Easter items—sold well during the month , but sales in other areas , including home products , pets and sporting goods were disappointing . Early signs suggest that April is following the March trend , and without Easter the measured increases against April last year will be very small or negative .

However , all the manufacturers contacted have projected significant real gains in 1985 . Manufacturing inventories are in line with sales , based on past experience ; but several contacts are not satisfied with this performance and are pushing to lower inventory-to-sales ratios . There is no evidence of any pickup in inflation ; recent price increases have been very modest and price expectations for 1985 seem to have moderated . Mortgage rates have been gradually falling for several months . Retailing Stores in the First District reported respectable but not spectacular sales increases over the preceding year in December and early January . Promotional activity reduced margins and inventories are somewhat above plan . Most merchants expressed optimism about sales growth in 1985 . Sales increases among the retailers contacted ranged from 6 to 10 percent above December 1983 . The recent year-over-year increases are generally smaller than those recorded earlier in 1984 , but most stores expected this because 1983 finished so strongly .

However , there is little speculative building , as builders remain cautious and uncertain about how long the current uptrend will last . Real estate firms had an exceptional second quarter . The volume of contract closings at one realty firm was the highest in two years , and its forecast for closings in the second half has been revised upward , but the firm will remain in a wait-and-see posture until August before deciding whether to increase its staff . More move-up buyers are reentering housing markets . Mortgage lending volume is picking up with the 15-year mortgage becoming popular and the adjustable rate mortgage losing favor among borrowers . In the second half of the year , mortgage markets in Ohio will receive a boost from recently approved state-subsidized mortgage money that amounts to $ 346 million and that will be available to qualifying home buyers at 9.8 percent . Commercial Banking District loan demand continues to be mixed . Loans outstanding in all major categories at large banks increased over the past month .

Domestic manufacturers report that their sales , when compared to 1984 , increased 9 percent through April . Slack demand in nonmetro areas has bogged down truck sales somewhat , though . Housing activity is also still slack in rural areas , but sales of homes in the Twin Cities have improved . Sales in both Minneapolis and St. Paul have been well above 1984 levels -- by more than 12 percent this February , for example .

270,"Beige Book Report : Minneapolis May 6 , 1985 While overall employment and consumer spending have recently increased in the Ninth District , agricultural and resource-related weaknesses have continued . Some signs of slower manufacturing growth are also evident . Employment District labor market conditions have continued to improve , regularly in the service sectors . Spurred by larger-than-usual quarterly employment growth , the district 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell a few tenths to 6.3 percent in the first quarter . Indicative of this improvement , Minnesota 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent in March , its lowest since August 1981 . Also in March , nonfarm employment reached a record high in Minnesota . Employment growth has been particularly evident in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area , which at the end of last year ranked fifth fastest in employment growth among large metro areas . Strong labor demand is present in Minneapolis , where the help-wanted advertising index was recently 11 percent above its year-earlier level . The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate also appears to have fallen in Montana , dropping from 7.6 percent in January to a probable 7 percent in March . Recent labor developments have been mixed . Layoffs at a conglomerate with plants in the Twin Cities and Sioux Falls , South Dakota , continued . As a result , the latter area 's unemployment rate rose measurably .

Only Richmond describes its District economy as strong , although there is some optimism in the reports from Philadelphia and New York . Retail sales gains are uneven , and less-than-robust Christmas sales are expected . Auto sales are low now that special interest rate incentives have largely ended . Industrial activity continues quite sluggish with few gains yet from dollar depreciation . Residential construction is improving but non-residential construction is uneven . Agricultural prices remain weak despite some rises in meat prices ; agricultural land prices continue to fall and farm finances remain weak . Commercial bank consumer and real estate lending is rising further but business lending is declining in most Districts . Retail Sales October retail sales other than autos are mind , with most Districts reporting moderate year-over-year gains . Sales are frequently described as strong for apparel and weak for various hardgoods . Inventories are generally at desired levels and are being built cautiously as most retailers expect Christmas sales to show only moderate increases from 1984 . New car sales continue to run well below year-ago levels in most Districts in reaction to the end of most special financing . However , Richmond and Dallas report sales were stronger than usual in October . Manufacturing and Mining Industrial activity continues to be quite sluggish .

Residential sales are strong in most areas , spurred by stable mortgage rates at just over 12 percent , rising incomes , and the availability of subsidized mortgage money in some states . House prices are reported to be firm and new listings strong . Nonresidential construction is generally weaker than residential building , but still healthy in many regions . There is some evidence that new construction may be slowing slightly , but projects already underway should provide continued strength . Many observers are surprised that nonresidential construction has not already lost steam , in view of rising vacancy rates and a general feeling that the office market is already overbuilt . Chicago notes that some projects have been started recently so that they will be grandfathered under the current tax code and thereby protected from future tax changes . Office leasing activity is mixed , with vacancy rates at suburban locations generally higher than in downtown areas . As a result , rents in suburban areas may hold steady or even fall in coming months . Agriculture While livestock farmers have gotten some measure of relief recently from higher livestock prices , crop farmers remain in financial stress in many areas , and may find their plight worsening . Harvests currently underway are likely to yield bumper crops that will drive farm prices and revenues even lower .

Many farmers are storing their harvest under Commodity Credit",0.5,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:45:05.6281816Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.5\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 77572, 525, 4961, 1154, 3650, 304, 5479, 315, 1532, 4261, 1380, 37101, 74993, 8881, 11924, 5557, 659, 54455, 6625, 525, 3746, 304, 1429, 5671, 1154, 84647, 553, 15175, 20846, 7813, 518, 1101, 916, 220, 16, 17, 3266, 1154, 16062, 45691, 1154, 323, 279, 18048, 315, 94014, 20846, 3220, 304, 1045, 5302, 659, 4678, 7576, 525, 4961, 311, 387, 7474, 323, 501, 25465, 3746, 659, 11581, 416, 11234, 8086, 374, 8789, 42283, 1091, 20057, 4752, 1154, 714, 2058, 9314, 304, 1657, 13604, 659, 2619, 374, 1045, 5904, 429, 501, 8086, 1231, 387, 47308, 10078, 1154, 714, 7079, 2669, 37099, 1265, 3410, 8570, 8170, 659, 8999, 36543, 525, 14453, 429, 2477, 416, 11234, 8086, 702, 537, 2669, 5558, 20312, 1154, 304, 1651, 315, 16062, 61462, 7813, 323, 264, 4586, 8266, 429, 279, 5163, 3081, 374, 2669, 916, 46239, 659, 10557, 8388, 429, 1045, 7079, 614, 1012, 3855, 5926, 773, 429, 807, 686, 387, 37850, 291, 1212, 279, 1482, 3742, 2038, 323, 27492, 2617, 504, 3853, 3742, 4344, 659, 8246, 70319, 5702, 374, 9519, 1154, 448, 61462, 7813, 518, 45218, 10468, 8789, 5080, 1091, 304, 18907, 5671, 659, 1634, 264, 1102, 1154, 61990, 304, 45218, 5671, 1231, 3331, 24020, 476, 1496, 4399, 304, 5001, 3951, 659, 36863, 5976, 50776, 20336, 614, 17019, 1045, 6629, 315, 15957, 5926, 504, 5080, 50776, 7576, 1154, 19097, 20336, 7146, 304, 5896, 8464, 304, 1657, 5671, 1154, 323, 1231, 1477, 862, 69975, 92305, 659, 55835, 82, 5023, 37099, 525, 4363, 311, 7540, 58885, 30565, 429, 686, 6541, 8785, 7576, 323, 29366, 1496, 4722, 6762, 8441, 20336, 525, 27572, 862, 23429, 1212, 1198, 51202, 16267, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3496441700, 'load_duration': 29364400, 'prompt_eval_count': 320, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1006353000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2457905000}"
273,"September 16 , 1985 Introduction This month 's commentaries on economic developments by the twelve Federal Reserve banks suggest general stability , with neither accelerating growth nor significant deterioration as near term prospects . This is indicated in key words and phrases in district summaries : Boston , `` retail sales improving , manufacturing in the doldrums '' ; New York , `` little growth '' ; Philadelphia , `` same as August '' ; Cleveland , `` soft and uneven '' ; Richmond , no `` broadbased improvement '' ; Atlanta , `` healthy on balance '' ; Chicago , `` no overall pickup or weakening '' ; St. Louis , `` continues to lag '' ; Minneapolis , `` a bit weaker '' ; Kansas City and Dallas , `` sluggish '' ; and San Francisco , '' signals are mixed '' . Among economic sectors , however , there are significant variations . Perhaps the most troubled sector , at present , is agriculture , with prices and income severely depressed . Total employment is growing moderately , but with great variation by region . Manufacturing output , overall , is about stable . Mining , including oil and gas development , is depressed . Retail sales are somewhat stronger , but mainly disappointing . Auto sales have been stimulated by special financing . Inventories are in fairly good balance , and all types of goods readily available . General price inflation is still in check—partly because of the heavy influx of imports",0.25,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:45:09.3430488Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.25\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 29549, 220, 16, 21, 1154, 220, 16, 24, 23, 20, 28338, 1096, 2254, 364, 82, 3980, 5431, 389, 6955, 24961, 553, 279, 29235, 12137, 24785, 13959, 4190, 4586, 19753, 1154, 448, 13866, 68641, 6513, 6329, 5089, 81089, 438, 3143, 4647, 26851, 659, 1096, 374, 16317, 304, 1376, 4244, 323, 31747, 304, 9290, 68922, 549, 10196, 1154, 9902, 10806, 6625, 18392, 1154, 14919, 304, 279, 294, 813, 81, 6237, 3355, 2587, 1532, 4261, 1154, 9902, 2632, 6513, 3355, 2587, 19335, 1154, 9902, 1852, 438, 6156, 3355, 2587, 23475, 1154, 9902, 8413, 323, 60337, 3355, 2587, 34248, 1154, 902, 9902, 7205, 29939, 15673, 3355, 2587, 19440, 1154, 9902, 9314, 389, 8172, 3355, 2587, 10557, 1154, 9902, 902, 8084, 29586, 476, 82426, 3355, 2587, 794, 13, 11876, 1154, 9902, 9539, 311, 21454, 3355, 2587, 41858, 1154, 9902, 264, 2699, 42283, 3355, 2587, 20148, 4311, 323, 18542, 1154, 9902, 86946, 3355, 2587, 323, 5836, 12879, 1154, 3355, 17289, 525, 9519, 3355, 659, 21658, 6955, 25512, 1154, 4764, 1154, 1052, 525, 5089, 26244, 659, 18765, 279, 1429, 41032, 10486, 1154, 518, 3042, 1154, 374, 28929, 1154, 448, 7576, 323, 7911, 34806, 41542, 659, 10657, 14402, 374, 7826, 69251, 1154, 714, 448, 2244, 22990, 553, 5537, 659, 41077, 2550, 1154, 8084, 1154, 374, 911, 15175, 659, 25832, 1154, 2670, 5590, 323, 6819, 4401, 1154, 374, 41542, 659, 34039, 6625, 525, 14400, 16245, 1154, 714, 14576, 38123, 659, 8979, 6625, 614, 1012, 80371, 553, 3281, 28542, 659, 92158, 2433, 525, 304, 14138, 1661, 8172, 1154, 323, 678, 4494, 315, 11561, 30268, 2500, 659, 3251, 3349, 24527, 374, 2058, 304, 1779, 2293, 4480, 398, 1576, 315, 279, 8811, 52852, 315, 15202, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 17, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3709247400, 'load_duration': 29817200, 'prompt_eval_count': 327, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1004248000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 2672864000}"
274,"December 5 , 1985 Overview Moat reports from around the Fifth District suggest that economic and business activity remains quite strong . Seasonal factors are causing some churning of employment activity , and special factors much as the end of the automobile financing opportunities of late summer and early fall are also causing some confusion . Nonetheless , employment , retail sales , construction , and housing sales are all reported , on balance , to be holding at quite high levels . Retail sales seem to be running well ahead of national trends , with experience varying significantly across product lines and regions . District employment has drawn recent support from construction , government , and to a lesser extent from manufacturing , sufficient to offset seasonal losses in agriculture related areas and tourism services . Manufacturing Manufacturing activity in the District , after leveling out in the past few months , is showing some signs of trying to bounce off of the bottom reached last summer . Several District states have experienced manufacturing employment gains lately , and even where employment shows continued weakness , average weekly hours of production workers has tuned up sharply . The modest gains achieved in the textile , apparel , and furniture industries a month ago are being held , and in some cases even built upon .

Some pickup in textile and apparel exports has developed of late providing some support for these industries , while in the furniture group , strong retail sales are beginning to",0.95,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:45:13.0325114Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.95\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 32146, 220, 20, 1154, 220, 16, 24, 23, 20, 34807, 6050, 266, 6682, 504, 2163, 279, 22843, 10942, 4190, 429, 6955, 323, 2562, 5702, 8458, 5008, 3746, 659, 14263, 278, 9363, 525, 14381, 1045, 521, 53344, 315, 14402, 5702, 1154, 323, 3281, 9363, 1753, 438, 279, 835, 315, 279, 34428, 28542, 10488, 315, 3309, 7324, 323, 4124, 4399, 525, 1083, 14381, 1045, 21340, 659, 55633, 1154, 14402, 1154, 10806, 6625, 1154, 8086, 1154, 323, 11721, 6625, 525, 678, 4961, 1154, 389, 8172, 1154, 311, 387, 9963, 518, 5008, 1550, 5866, 659, 34039, 6625, 2803, 311, 387, 4303, 1632, 8305, 315, 5313, 18339, 1154, 448, 3139, 28765, 11941, 3941, 1985, 5128, 323, 13604, 659, 10942, 14402, 702, 14764, 3213, 1824, 504, 8086, 1154, 3033, 1154, 323, 311, 264, 31315, 12818, 504, 14919, 1154, 14016, 311, 4347, 35799, 17683, 304, 28929, 5435, 5671, 323, 30983, 3516, 659, 41077, 41077, 5702, 304, 279, 10942, 1154, 1283, 72985, 700, 304, 279, 3267, 2421, 3951, 1154, 374, 9027, 1045, 11929, 315, 4460, 311, 33682, 1007, 315, 279, 5622, 8643, 1537, 7324, 659, 25694, 10942, 5302, 614, 10321, 14919, 14402, 19619, 30345, 1154, 323, 1496, 1380, 14402, 4933, 8570, 23078, 1154, 5461, 17059, 4115, 315, 5670, 7337, 702, 32419, 705, 45373, 659, 576, 26848, 19619, 16994, 304, 279, 65538, 1154, 54325, 1154, 323, 14549, 19102, 264, 2254, 4134, 525, 1660, 5644, 1154, 323, 304, 1045, 5048, 1496, 5798, 5193, 6762, 8373, 29586, 304, 65538, 323, 54325, 12794, 702, 7881, 315, 3309, 8241, 1045, 1824, 369, 1493, 19102, 1154, 1393, 304, 279, 14549, 1874, 1154, 3746, 10806, 6625, 525, 7167, 311, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 24, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3682315300, 'load_duration': 14779800, 'prompt_eval_count': 318, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1028688000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 2635744000}"
275,"August 6 , 1985 Overview Business and economic conditions in the Fifth District continue to reflect somewhat disparate performance across sectors . On balance , activity seems flat to rising slightly . Some of the areas of earlier strength continue to lend support , while others , notably the retail sector , have softened markedly . Construction activity and house sales remain upbeat . Manufacturing is flat to down slightly , although there is some indication that the slide in manufacturing employment has been arrested . Coal production remains below year earlier , although stocks have been drawn down significantly since year-end . The service sector remains the primary source of employment growth . The outlook fur agriculture has improved somewhat of late because of much improved weather conditions . Manufacturing There is little evidence of any significant turnaround in the manufacturing sector despite a modestly improved employment situation . According to our reports , manufacturing shipments stabilized over the past month , although new orders and order backlogs both declined . Month to month changes continue to be dominated by such sectors as textiles , apparel , and furniture where imports continue to gain market share . Some of this weakness has been offset recently by very modest gains in primary and fabricated metals , food products , and segments of the chemicals industry .

Coal production continues to run slightly below year ago levels , but recent employment losses appear to have been stemmed in this industry as well .

However , pressure on costs is sufficiently severe that production increases do not result necessarily in more jobs . Mining sectors remain weak , with low prices and reduced employment in petroleum . With the exception of major gold mining and refining operations which have realized recent strength , there is no sign of improvement in the beleaguered mineral mining sector . Construction and Real Estate In general , building has been strong , although high vacancy rates in commercial and residential property in most parts of the district portend reduced construction activity in the future . While building permits remain strong in Phoenix , for example , many issued permits are not being used . Much of the residential building is focused on multifamily dwellings . In some markets , signals are mixed . For example , in Idaho , May residential permits were 28 percent below May 1984 , but the value of commercial construction was 45 percent above May 1984 . Agriculture Natural and human misfortunes have combined with longer run problems to make this a bad time for most western agriculture .

Agriculture Recent rain is helping pastures return to normal in drought-stricken areas and may prevent further crop losses , especially for soybeans and cotton . Even so , existing damage to major crops suggests that revenue of farmers in Alabama , Georgia , and Tennessee will fall far short of production costs . In addition to severe crop losses from the summer drought , the Southeast is experiencing substantial damage to its timber industry . In Georgia and Alabama total forestry losses may exceed $ 30 million . At mid-year , the Federal Land Bank of Jackson , Mississippi , was one of four in the nation requiring a transfer of funds from the eight other FLB 's to maintain solvency .

Expansion of both goods- and services-producing industries contributed to substantial employment growth in recent months . Retail sales have been strong this year with growth surpassing that of the nation . Respondents expect mortgage refinancing to result in increased disposable income that may boost future consumer spending . Spurred by mild weather in the region , construction activity in the first quarter also exceeded national figures . Financial and agricultural indicators are less encouraging , with commercial and consumer lending slowing in the first quarter and no change in the forecast of low prices for District farm products . Employment Eighth District nonagricultural employment grew at a 1.2 percent annual rate in February , trailing the 1.9 percent national rate . In the three-month period ending in February , however , the 10.7 percent growth rate of District nonagricultural employment exceeded the nation 's 3.6 percent rate . District manufacturing employment increased at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months ending in February compared with a 2.1 percent rate for the nation . Despite these strong employment figures , even faster growth in the labor force raised the Eighth District unemployment rate in February from 7.7 to 8.0 percent .

A number of merchants reported difficulty in keeping stores and home offices fully staffed . Turnover is rising ( `` because it is so easy for employees to find new jobs '' ) and it is difficult to hire new employees , especially at the lower-paid end of the market . Forecasts for the remainder of the year are closely tied to recent performance . For stores performing poorly , this represents a more negative outlook compared with earlier this year . Apparel Prices Because of the sizable apparel price increase in the CPI , inquiries about the sources of this increase were made among First District retailers . These retailers report that apparel import prices are rising substantially ( 10-25 percent compared to a year earlier ) ; they lay the blame for these increases on both the quota system and the decline in the value of the dollar . Prices of domestically produced apparel are increasing more gradually ; these domestic price increases are attributed to rising textile prices . Strong demand for apparel is leading to increases in the prices at which quotas are bought and sold among overseas manufacturers . Also , because the quotas limit the quantity ( not value ) of goods that foreign producers can send to the United States , the items now imported include fewer inexpensive goods .

One Arizona electronics manufacturer exports about 30 percent of its product to Japan . U.S. companies that have shifted manufacturing activities to Japan also expressed concern about the potential impact of more stringent tariffs . At the same time , some argue that the escalating trade friction has opened up Japanese markets to U.S. firms . In addition , both Taiwan and South Korea , fearing possible retaliatory actions against them , have taken significant steps to reduce tariffs and duties on a large number of items . Moreover , Japanese firms can be expected to continue shifting more production to the U.S. , with California a prime candidate for that investment . Finally , if allegations about semiconductor `` dumping '' are true , and if U.S. trade measures curtail dumping , western electronics firms should benefit . Agriculture and Resource Related Industries Prices for cattle and sheep have increased and reportedly are reaching profitable levels . However , ranchers remain cautious because higher prices tend to attract foreign imports in both markets . Prices of apples , potatoes and milk also have risen .

Women 's apparel sales have remained weak and the gains which occurred in other lines were not particularly strong . Year-to-year changes at District stores in April ranged from -6.9 percent to +3.3 percent , results which were `` well below '' to `` just about on '' plan . Partial data for May show some over-the-year gains but smaller than were expected . Inventories were generally at comfortable levels , however , due to close monitoring and aggressive markdowns , though one respondent reported an undesired buildup .

However , in March unemployment rose in Illinois and Michigan in contrast with the further national decline . Hiring plans are strong in the Midwest . Chicago purchasing managers surveyed in March indicated that expansion of production , orders , and backlogs continued but was less widespread than last year . This less heated expansion was reflected in prices paid , which showed widespread increases but less so than earlier . Milwaukee purchasers ' reports have shown a similar trend over the past year . Higher petroleum prices are boosting costs for industry , transportation , and consumers .

309,"September 20 , 1989 Summary Retailers appear more optimistic about sales prospects for the balance of this year , although sales patterns have been mixed . Manufacturing activity remains at high levels , but softening is apparent even in some capital goods industries . Steel operations have been reduced largely because of inventory liquidation . Commercial and industrial loans continue to soften . Money market rates are expected to ease over the next few months , and the thrift bailout has resulted in lower rates on CDs issued by thrifts . Retail Sales Department store retailers have become more optimistic about fall and holiday-season sales prospects apparently because of better- than-expected sales so far this summer . Apparel sales in particular revived from the slump in 1988 , and profits and profit margins improved last quarter without more than usual sales promotions . Retailers plan to hold larger inventories than they did late last year . A chain department store , however , believes that retailers are too optimistic and that inventories will become a growing problem over the next few months .

310,"May 3 , 1989 The economy shows some mixed signs of slowing , led by consumer spending and residential construction . The worst of the surge in food and energy prices is probably over , assuming improved supplies . Higher interest rates are generally not considered to have had much effect on housing and other construction , or on capital goods industries . Thrifts continue to experience deposit outflows , although the April outflow apparently was not as severe as in previous months this year . Consumer Spending Several retailers report sales were better-than-expected over the past 6 weeks , and better than what has been reported in national data . Some retailers expect sales to soften this quarter , especially because of higher gasoline prices . An upscale retailer , however , noted a double-digit increase in spending last quarter and believes his upper-income customers are not much affected by a rise in interest rates . The automotive industry apparently is successfully offsetting higher interest rates by offering special financing rates and cash rebates that are the broadest and , in some cases , the most generous yet offered . Incentives are not as broad for foreign cars . Auto dealers report strengthening sales in early April . They generally are guardedly optimistic over spring and summer sales but are more cautious than dealers surveyed in early March .

323,"but they anticipate some slackening in the expansion of commercial and industrial lending in the second half of the year . Manufacturing Activity in the Third District industrial sector appears to be easing to a steady pace . Just over half of the manufacturers contacted in late March and early April reported that business was stable , and the number noting improvement barely exceeded the number indicating that their business was slowing . Reports of improvement were common among nondurable goods producers while most makers of durables said business has been flat in recent weeks . Overall , executives at area industrial firms generally noted modest increases in new orders and a fractional rise in shipments but no change in order backlogs during March . On balance , area firms are permitting inventories to run down for the fourth month in a row . Employment is holding up as area manufacturing firms added marginally to payrolls during March . Industrial prices in the region continue to rise . Nearly half of the manufacturers contacted in April said input costs moved up from a month earlier and one-quarter raised the prices of the products they make . The increases do not appear to be accelerating , however , as reports of higher prices are not quite as widespread now as they were over the winter . Nevertheless , local manufacturers generally expect continued upward price pressure . Looking ahead , local manufacturers see virtually steady conditions over the next six months .

324,"the survey participants responding in early March said their business was moving up from last month while 12 percent reported slower operations . Specific measures of industrial activity reflect this fractional growth . Area firms are booking more new orders than they did last month and they are stepping up shipments enough to work down order backlogs a bit . Inventories are level with last month . Employment shows only a little improvement as both payrolls and working hours are moving up just marginally . Survey respondents continue to report rising prices , although such indications do not appear to be as widespread this month as they have been for the past year . Nearly one-half of the firms polled for the March survey are paying higher prices for purchased goods compared to a month ago and one-quarter are charging more for their own products . Local manufacturers forecast only steady activity for the next six months , an improvement from the January and February surveys in which expectations of a downturn prevailed . The balance of responses to the most recent poll indicates that managers at area plants expect the rate of both new orders and shipments to be fairly flat for the next two quarters , and they anticipate a further decline in order backlogs . In accordance with these expectations , local firms ' employment plans call for steady payrolls and some shortening of the workweek between now and September .

Growth in dollar sales are generally reported to have run 5-10 percent above last year for January and February . Discount merchants have achieved somewhat better results than other retailers , probably due to greater promotional efforts , according to store officials . Most retailers say apparel sales are showing some improvement after the slowdown of the past few years , and several merchants noted renewed consumer demand for hard goods and electronic items . Third District automobile dealers report a pickup in sales in late January as manufacturers stepped up incentives in response to some mid-January slowness . Dealers believe that matching last year 's rate of unit sales is possible this year as long as consumer Income remains strong and interest rates do not rise sharply . Nevertheless , dealers say their profit margins remain under pressure from rising costs and declining gross receipts . Finance Loan volume outstanding at major Third District banks in February was approximately 13 percent above the year-ago level and bankers contacted in early March said this pace of growth was being generally maintained .

334,"June 20 , 1990 The tone of District reports suggests continued slow growth in the economy with little change in the underlying inflation rate . Reports on the behavior of consumption are mixed , and construction is indicated to be softening further . Capital goods industries are , on balance , pointing toward growth , and manufacturing is expected to strengthen in several Districts . Recent behavior in retail sales and reports from retailers in several Districts indicate that sales have been slow in recent months , and are expected to remain so in the short term . It is unclear how much of the recent softness in retail sales represents temporary factors , such as unusual weather over the last several months . Both residential and nonresidential construction have been edging downward in recent months in most Districts , and indicators of future construction suggest further softening . Prospects for a good harvest this year should be improved as a result of ample rainfall in previously drought-stricken regions of the country , but cool , wet weather has delayed planting by as much as several weeks . The slow-growth economy is accompanied by an easing in demand for credit . Real estate loans , consumer loans , and business loans are still growing , but at reduced rates in recent months . Lenders are reported to have tightened standards especially for real estate loans , but there is still little information that suggests credit restraint is spreading into other markets .

Improvement was noted among producers of chemicals , electrical machinery , and stone , clay , and glass products . Most of the firms experiencing slower business were producers of nondurable goods such as apparel , food products , and paper and paper goods , although primary metal producers indicated some weakness , also . Overall , Third District manufacturers noted a steady rate of new orders , a marginal pickup in shipments , and a drop in order backlogs . Although most of the firms surveyed were maintaining steady employment levels and working hours , on net , they continued to make fractional cuts in personnel and hours . Industrial prices in the region were steady , with three-fourths of the companies polled holding prices of their products steady and nearly nine-out-of-ten reporting stable input costs . Looking ahead , Third District manufacturers generally foresee improvement in the second half of the year .

338,"December did not appear to be consistent with the stronger performance in earlier fall months , after taking seasonal factors into account . Merchants contacted in early January said sales were running about even with or slightly above the year-ago pace . For the rest of the winter , most retailers expect sales to just match last year 's , in real terms . None of the store executives surveyed expressed strong optimism for the coming spring season . Several mentioned concern in the industry that major national retailers who are facing cash-flow difficulties might step up price discounting . After heavy discounting this Christmas , retailers are looking to reestablish stable pricing policies before the spring selling season begins . Finance Total loan volume at major Third District banks in late December was approximately 15 percent above the same period in the prior year , although growth appeared to ease during the month . Bankers contacted in early January said a slowdown in the rate of growth was continuing . Most expect overall loan demand to move up only modestly as the national economy enters at least one or two quarters of slower growth . As the new year began , commercial and industrial lending was being scaled back at several large banks in the district as conditions in some sectors prompted credit reviews of companies in those industries . Builders and retailers , in particular , were being reviewed and some reductions in loan commitments were being made .

339,". Manufacturing Our regular mail survey suggested that District manufacturing activity declined slightly in early November . Respondents indicated that shipments , orders , and employment declined , but that inventories of raw materials and finished goods changed little . Most manufacturers felt that poor sales were their biggest problem , and manufacturers of furniture , textiles and apparel said their industries were definitely in recessions . Some manufacturers said that customers were increasingly reluctant to order very far ahead . Raw materials prices rose , but most manufacturers apparently held finished product prices steady . Even firms that use petroleum-based inputs like chemicals and plastics said that they had absorbed sharp increases in their raw material costs and had not increased prices of their finished goods . Manufacturers saw weakness in current economic conditions , but they were somewhat less pessimistic than a month ago about prospects for business next year . Most respondents believed that economic activity weakened in their local areas and in the nation in early November , and about half expected further weakening in the months ahead . A significantly larger number of respondents in November than in October , however , expected activity to pick up in coming months .

Port Activity Officials at District ports—Baltimore , Charleston , and Hampton Roads ( Norfolk ) —indicated that , seasonally adjusted , exports rose in October from September and imports were generally unchanged . Compared with a year ago , export activity was higher and import activity was mixed .

They complain that it is difficult to obtain high quality loan applications . Much of the reported increase in demand was attributed to market share gains by the reporting banks as borrowers moved from troubled or merged institutions . On the other hand , one banker said that his institution may have tightened credit standards too much and was losing market share as a result . Auto dealers and construction contractors continue to report that credit is difficult to obtain . Construction Most realtor contacts had seen home sales levelling in their typical seasonal pattern in October and early November . Homes in the lower price range continued to report the most sales activity as lower mortgage interest rates stimulated first-time home buyers . Sales of higher priced homes remained sluggish , forcing sellers to reduce prices . Some contacts noted a strengthening in multifamily leasing and rental rates ; however , they saw little new construction of multifamily residences . Meanwhile , several contacts report small gains in the activity of surviving home builders in the past several months . The commercial real estate market has shown little change in this reporting period .

Commercial office space remains overbuilt in many cities , with effective rental rates depressed , and little or no improvement in absorption .

Although the range of year- to-year sales growth was quite similar for both months -- flat to +15 percent in April as compared to -3 percent to +15 percent in May -- more stores were clustered near the bottom of the range during the most recent period . Easter boosted sales of children 's clothing in April , while unusually cool weather slowed apparel sales the following month . All contacts reported inventories on plan . Fifteen New York metropolitan area department stores are scheduled to close by summer 's end , resulting in the loss of 7,200 jobs . Several of the stores are the last remaining retail anchors in older downtown areas ; the Fordham Road section of the Bronx and downtown Newark and New Rochelle are expected to be particularly hard hit .

380,"June 23 , 1993 Summary Economic expansion in the District continued in May and early June . Reports from retailers and consumer goods manufacturers suggest that retail sales growth picked up modestly , aided in part by pent-up demand after unseasonably bad weather in the first quarter . Manufacturing activity continued its expansion , with slowing growth in some sectors offset by improving results in several industries that had previously been weak . Motor vehicle production continued to gain momentum , with output plans for the third quarter calling for a significant increase over year-earlier levels . Survey-based measures and reports from individual businesses gave no evidence of significant upward pressure on prices . Retail Sales Reports from large retailers and manufacturers of consumer goods suggest that consumer demand increased in the District in recent months . A large department store chain reported that sales growth in the Midwest increased moderately ( on a seasonally adjusted basis ) in May and early June , after a snapback in April from weather-depressed levels in the first quarter . Sales strength remained concentrated in durable goods , notably appliances and home improvement items . Credit utilization continued to rise and delinquency rates continued to improve .

A manufacturer of heavy equipment experiencing renewed strength in most of its business lines cited the lack of a generalized upturn in demand for commodities as the most important factor leading sales of mining equipment to lag the companywide average . One manufacturer in an international market stated `` many of the price increases we do see are coming from the import side . '' Agriculture The pace in crop plantings improved considerably in recent weeks , overcoming most of the earlier delays from cool , wet weather . The delays may result in some modest shifting in the mix of crop acres . However , analysts believe that virtually all of the intended corn acreage in District states was seeded prior to the passing of critical planting dates . ( June 15 is generally regarded as the latest acceptable date for planting corn . ) Early crop development -- both for field crops and for much of the District 's vegetable acreage -- is below normal due to the late plantings . However , moisture supplies in most areas are adequate to abundant and the return of warmer weather brings hopes for faster crop development .",0.5,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:51:19.4366217Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.5\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 51798, 1083, 23943, 553, 19117, 31062, 659, 362, 13963, 315, 8811, 7096, 24084, 35546, 8170, 304, 1429, 315, 1181, 2562, 5128, 21870, 279, 6853, 315, 264, 66117, 705, 412, 304, 7479, 369, 50867, 438, 279, 1429, 2989, 8168, 6388, 6625, 315, 11673, 7096, 311, 21454, 279, 2813, 9150, 5461, 659, 3776, 13963, 304, 458, 6489, 3081, 10982, 9902, 1657, 315, 279, 3349, 12703, 582, 653, 1490, 525, 5001, 504, 279, 1159, 3108, 659, 3355, 36863, 576, 17857, 304, 19097, 6008, 819, 12944, 32352, 304, 3213, 5555, 1154, 72917, 1429, 315, 279, 6788, 31074, 504, 7010, 1154, 14401, 9104, 659, 576, 31074, 1231, 1102, 304, 1045, 26848, 31831, 304, 279, 6514, 315, 19097, 26367, 659, 4354, 1154, 30399, 4411, 429, 21214, 678, 315, 279, 10602, 13776, 45223, 424, 304, 10942, 5302, 572, 89816, 4867, 311, 279, 12299, 315, 9023, 47014, 12713, 659, 320, 5534, 220, 16, 20, 374, 8789, 26361, 438, 279, 5535, 21555, 2400, 369, 47014, 13776, 659, 873, 22752, 19097, 4401, 1177, 2176, 369, 2070, 30565, 323, 369, 1753, 315, 279, 10942, 364, 82, 35481, 45223, 424, 1177, 374, 3685, 4622, 4152, 311, 279, 3309, 6008, 819, 659, 4354, 1154, 31157, 16720, 304, 1429, 5671, 525, 25532, 311, 43511, 323, 279, 470, 315, 44939, 9104, 12434, 16005, 369, 10596, 19097, 4401, 659, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3373533000, 'load_duration': 16974300, 'prompt_eval_count': 267, 'prompt_eval_duration': 917815000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2436062000}"
382,"March 10 , 1993 Summary District business activity continues to improve . Consumer spending is stronger than retailers expected after the December buying spree , with spring apparel and household durables selling particularly well . Orders and production schedules for many manufacturers , including steel , autos , and capital goods , are higher this quarter than last . Increased production and orders have led some companies to rehire workers , but employment gains still lag far behind output growth . Lenders report an increase in credit-card use and mortgage refinancing , but little growth in business loans . Consumer Spending District retail sales continue to be stronger than retailers expected , with sales reported to be 5 % to 10 % higher than last year at this time . The post-holiday performance has been particularly impressive because the companies interviewed have not been discounting prices heavily , as inventories of leftover winter goods are low and early orders for spring merchandise were conservative . Demand for spring fashions is significant , and consumers appear particularly interested in new design items as opposed to basic apparel . Retailers see this trend as indicating that consumers are moving beyond basic needs to more discretionary items . Durable goods , including high-end entertainment electronics , have also been moving well .

Pittsburgh area retailers point to an improving new home market as a major source of increasing demand for household durables , such as furniture and appliances .

Commercial real estate continues steady , while investment management firms report strong growth . Retail Winter storms and cold temperatures took a considerable bite out of retail sales in the First District . Sales in January and early February were either flat or down , in some cases as much as 15 percent , compared to year-earlier levels . Apparel stores were particularly hard hit ; fewer shoppers took advantage of January promotions , leaving retailers with excess inventories of seasonal clothing .

398,"May 4 , 1994 Summary Seventh District economic conditions continued to improve in March and April , with retail sales boosted by substantially greater improvement in the weather than the norm for this time of year . Aside from the weather effects , the underlying upward momentum in consumption and housing activity may have slowed somewhat from the unusually rapid fourth quarter pace . Reports from manufacturers generally remained quite upbeat , although a number of manufacturing contacts expressed greater uncertainty about the pace of activity in their markets in the latter half of 1994 , citing the effects of increases in interest rates . Reports of price increases remained concentrated in building materials and metals industries . Early planting and weaker export prospects are currently weighing on crop prices , but District farmland values continued to appreciate in early 1994 . Retail Sales and Housing Consumer spending and housing activity continued to expand in the District in recent months , aided by substantial improvement in the weather following unusually harsh conditions earlier in the year . A large general merchandise retailer stated that underlying sales momentum remained positive through early April , with sales of home furnishings and other housing-related items still leading overall sales growth . This firm 's outstanding consumer loans are sill rising , while delinquency rates continue to decline .

Another large national retailer reported that its sales growth slowed in April on a holiday-adjusted basis . A large retail chain concentrated in the District reported that sales of seasonal items",0.8,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:52:17.5099165Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.8\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 11109, 220, 19, 1154, 220, 16, 24, 24, 19, 21517, 74625, 10942, 6955, 4682, 8570, 311, 7269, 304, 5470, 323, 5813, 1154, 448, 10806, 6625, 64108, 553, 31202, 7046, 15673, 304, 279, 9104, 1091, 279, 7465, 369, 419, 882, 315, 1042, 659, 56094, 504, 279, 9104, 6239, 1154, 279, 16533, 39772, 23270, 304, 15293, 323, 11721, 5702, 1231, 614, 47846, 14400, 504, 279, 56799, 11048, 11737, 8338, 17857, 659, 28040, 504, 16621, 8789, 14616, 5008, 84673, 1154, 7892, 264, 1372, 315, 14919, 18508, 13302, 7046, 26826, 911, 279, 17857, 315, 5702, 304, 862, 11725, 304, 279, 15271, 4279, 315, 220, 16, 24, 24, 19, 1154, 32164, 279, 6239, 315, 12703, 304, 2734, 7813, 659, 28040, 315, 3349, 12703, 14616, 37526, 304, 4752, 7236, 323, 36082, 19102, 659, 22752, 47014, 323, 42283, 7485, 26851, 525, 5023, 46726, 389, 19097, 7576, 1154, 714, 10942, 3041, 85694, 2750, 8570, 311, 15401, 304, 4124, 220, 16, 24, 24, 19, 659, 34039, 15829, 323, 30333, 25197, 10164, 323, 11721, 5702, 8570, 311, 9225, 304, 279, 10942, 304, 3213, 3951, 1154, 62857, 553, 11924, 15673, 304, 279, 9104, 2701, 56799, 24939, 4682, 6788, 304, 279, 1042, 659, 362, 3460, 4586, 34945, 36791, 10982, 429, 16533, 6625, 23270, 14616, 6785, 1526, 4124, 5813, 1154, 448, 6625, 315, 2114, 72171, 323, 1008, 11721, 13904, 3589, 2058, 6388, 8084, 6625, 6513, 659, 1096, 7474, 364, 82, 18781, 11502, 16606, 525, 84267, 16062, 1154, 1393, 1594, 52888, 2251, 7813, 3060, 311, 17704, 6762, 14037, 3460, 5313, 36791, 4961, 429, 1181, 6625, 6513, 47846, 304, 5813, 389, 264, 13257, 59584, 291, 8037, 659, 362, 3460, 10806, 8781, 37526, 304, 279, 10942, 4961, 429, 6625, 315, 35799, 3589, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 23, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3485968300, 'load_duration': 12989900, 'prompt_eval_count': 330, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1016046000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2454115000}"

A survey of a large number of smaller retailers in Illinois and Indiana continued to show an improving trend in recent months . Home sales and construction activity surged in the region as 1993 came to a close , with little sign of a slowdown in the underlying momentum thus far in 1994 . Some realty and banking contacts attributed at least part of the increased activity to home buyers ' beliefs that mortgage interest rates may have stopped declining , leading sonic to conclude that the recent burst in activity could prove short-lived . Still , reports from local realtor boards in the region remained quite optimistic , with most noting that sales closings rose faster in January and February than in late 1993 . At the same time , the bad weather postponed home showings , which could be followed by slower growth in closings in March and April . One of the largest realtors in the District reported that transactions in January rose over 30 percent from year-earlier levels , partly due to special factors , but results were still a good deal better than expected .

400,"January and February 1993 , but retailers appear optimistic about recent sales gains and their implications for longer-term consumer demand . However , all of the respondents did speak of increasingly competitive market conditions and thinning profit margins . Housing and Construction The extremely strong performance of the housing sector in the last part of 1993 is not seen as sustainable . There is a sense that some of last year 's activity was driven by a belief that interest rates had reached their trough , triggering some amount of speculative buying . Nonetheless , 1994 is expected to be solid , reflecting strong underlying demand due to demographic factors , moderating long-term interest rates , and slight increases in income and employment . Housing markets in the Fourth District have been strong for some time , and more of the same is expected for 1994 . Lending Activity Consumers are said to `` look healthy '' : Delinquency rates are low and indexes of borrowing by existing customers are their strongest in more than two years . Commercial loans , which were down at the end of 1993 , picked up somewhat at the beginning of the year . The rise in interest rates has cooled mortgage refinancings , and slower growth in consumer loans is expected to ensue as a result of mortgage borrowing having reached its peak .

Retail sales in most districts have improved , with nearly all districts reporting strong sales early in the holiday season . Manufacturing activity is increasing further in most districts , especially in durable goods industries , and the service sector is continuing to show strength . While single-family homebuilding continues to slow across most districts , commercial real estate markets and nonresidential construction have picked up in many districts . Loan demand is up in most districts , led by consumer loans and commercial and industrial lending . Farmers have harvested large crops in most parts of the nation but face generally low prices , as do cattle and hog producers . Energy activity in regions producing oil and natural gas has picked up somewhat . Prices of raw and intermediate materials continue to advance , with reports of some increases being passed through to final product prices .

418,"March 15 , 1995 The pace of New England 's economic expansion shows some signs of moderating . Manufacturing activity continues to grow at a rate that varies from modest to robust . But most manufacturers also note selected areas of market weakness , and the region 's retailers report disappointing results . While commodity prices continue to rise , some contacts report signs of deceleration ; sales prices remain stable at most firms . Retail First District retail contacts were disappointed with January and February sales , which mostly ranged from level to 10 percent below year-ago levels . Retailers indicated , however , that year-over-year comparisons were misleading because last year saw sales fluctuations caused by winter storms while this year 's weather is unseasonably warm . Poor sellers were apparel , particularly winter clothing , snow- removal equipment , housewares , sports equipment , and ready-to- assemble furniture . Home office and electronics continued to perform well . Reports on price increases varied considerably . A few retailers cited an overall rise of 2 to 3 percent in vendor prices , and increases of over 10 percent on leather , plastic , and paper products .

Autos Mixed impressions have emerged from the District 's major auto markets , with sales in Ohio better than in southwest Pennsylvania On balance , however , District auto sales during the last six weeks are down from the same period a year ago . Dealers cite a number of factors , including the unseasonable weather and higher interest rates , for this weakness . New car loan rates are approaching , or in some cases have already reached , double-digit levels . Surprisingly , auto credit is reported to be readily available , and local finance markets are said to be aggressively competing for borrowers . Moreover , higher bank rates for vehicle loans are being partially offset by factory incentives , including special financing arrangements and cash rebates . Auto inventories are higher than desired in many District markets . However , there are still shortages of a few popular vehicles , apparently resulting from production glitches rather than a shortage of capacity . Banking and Credit Loan activity is reported to be good , although some softening has been felt very recently , particularly in consumer lending .

Competition for borrowers continues to intensify , and several sources note an easing in credit standards , although this may simply be an adjustment to the `` artificially '' tight standards coming out of the last recession .

Retail sales improved and manufacturers continued to operate at high levels of capacity . While single-family homebuilding slowed further , multifamily construction picked up in some parts of the district The district 's winter wheat crop was generally in good condition , and recent gains in crop and livestock prices have brightened the outlook for district farm incomes . While materials prices for manufacturers continued to rise throughout the region , upward pressure on wages was less prevalent . Retailers held prices steady despite increases in costs of goods and labor . Retail Sales Retailers report that sales improved over the past month and were ahead of year-ago sales . Much of the improvement , however , can be attributed to recent clearance promotions . Unseasonably warm weather continued to hamper sales of outerwear and other seasonal merchandise . Although retailers trimmed inventories , current inventory levels are generally considered satisfactory . Most auto dealers report slightly declining sales over the past month , due primarily to higher financing costs for consumers . Nevertheless , auto dealers expect sales to pick up in the spring . Manufacturing Most firms continued to operate at high levels of capacity last month . Manufacturing lead times increased but are expected to shorten in the months ahead .

Firms are generally satisfied with current inventory levels , although a few may boost inventories slightly to meet demand or to",0.95,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:53:39.7108211Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.95\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 27523, 220, 16, 20, 1154, 220, 16, 24, 24, 20, 34807, 576, 350, 20684, 10942, 8584, 8570, 311, 3063, 518, 264, 3746, 17857, 916, 279, 3267, 2254, 659, 34039, 6625, 12944, 323, 16621, 8570, 311, 14476, 518, 1550, 5866, 315, 8654, 659, 5976, 3175, 17190, 2114, 23296, 47846, 4623, 1154, 61287, 5174, 8086, 12771, 705, 304, 1045, 5479, 315, 279, 9290, 576, 9290, 364, 82, 12406, 33053, 19097, 572, 8789, 304, 1661, 2971, 1154, 323, 3213, 19619, 304, 19097, 323, 50776, 7576, 614, 9906, 6758, 279, 35621, 369, 9290, 8785, 45691, 659, 5976, 7236, 7576, 369, 16621, 8570, 311, 10000, 6814, 279, 5537, 1154, 39772, 7262, 389, 23123, 572, 2686, 45841, 659, 34039, 388, 5644, 7576, 24020, 8818, 12703, 304, 7049, 315, 11561, 323, 9327, 659, 34039, 15829, 34039, 388, 1895, 429, 6625, 12944, 916, 279, 3267, 2254, 323, 1033, 8305, 315, 1042, 12, 6304, 6625, 659, 23309, 315, 279, 15673, 1154, 4764, 1154, 646, 387, 29606, 311, 3213, 35554, 35971, 659, 1230, 16798, 2845, 8205, 9104, 8570, 311, 13515, 712, 6625, 315, 15955, 22744, 323, 1008, 35799, 34945, 659, 10328, 29182, 50981, 17023, 2433, 1154, 1482, 15444, 5866, 525, 8789, 6509, 57731, 659, 7496, 3233, 26199, 1895, 10078, 42748, 6625, 916, 279, 3267, 2254, 1154, 4152, 15503, 311, 5080, 28542, 7049, 369, 13417, 659, 33953, 1154, 3233, 26199, 1720, 6625, 311, 3735, 705, 304, 279, 10464, 659, 41077, 7496, 18809, 8570, 311, 14476, 518, 1550, 5866, 315, 8654, 1537, 2254, 659, 41077, 2990, 3039, 7172, 714, 525, 3601, 311, 73381, 304, 279, 3951, 8305, 6762, 37, 14404, 525, 8789, 19527, 448, 1482, 15444, 5866, 1154, 7892, 264, 2421, 1231, 7760, 17023, 2433, 10078, 311, 3367, 7479, 476, 311, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 24, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3673883700, 'load_duration': 25326300, 'prompt_eval_count': 333, 'prompt_eval_duration': 999775000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 2645554000}"

Grain prices , especially wheat , are up in response to low carryover and poor crop prospects . In contrast to the improved situation for crops , livestock production continues to have severe problems . Cattle and hog prices remain depressed and the recent runup in grain costs is further squeezing producers . Periods of extreme heat in mid-July slowed livestock gains and caused severe death losses for district turkey producers . Banking and finance '' All appear headed for another year of record earnings , '' is one Minnesota newspaper 's description of performance at major Minnesota- based banking , finance and investment companies . Strong profits generally characterize banks of all sizes across the district . Small agricultural banks in livestock-dependent areas are an exception ; their managers expressed concerns about loan losses and profitability in a survey of agricultural credit conditions . Consumer spending and tourism '' We are having to work harder and harder to keep sales up to projections , '' says the CEO of a chain of appliance and electronics stores .

Manufacturing Manufacturing activity in the Third District maintained a level pace in February according to reports from industrial firms , although slightly more firms said they were experiencing a pickup than said business was off . Firms in most of the major manufacturing sectors in the District indicated that demand for their products was just steady . However , some gains in orders were noted by firms producing metal products , nonelectrical machinery , chemicals , paper products , and textiles . Overall , however , demand for manufactured products did not appear to be strengthening for firms in the region ; on balance , they reported that order backlogs continued on the downward trend that began late last year . A dip in employment and a decline in industrial prices that manufacturers noted in February are further evidence of slack in the goods-producing sector of the District . Looking ahead , most of the Third District manufacturers contacted in February expect demand for their products to pick up by summer . On balance , they foresee a rising pace of orders and shipments , but they do not expect order backlogs to move up strongly . Likewise , they anticipate only very slight increases in employment . Retail Most of the retailers contacted for this report said sales at their stores rebounded in February from the slackened pace of January when snowstorms seriously hampered road travel and kept shoppers at home .

Though these shortages were broad-based , information technology and construction workers were most often cited as being in short supply and accounting professionals were again hard to find heading into the upcoming tax season .

Manufacturing materials were generally available , with only spotty evidence of marginal increases in lead times . Inventories last month were flat , and managers reported mixed feelings about their satisfaction with current stock levels . However , manufacturers plan to trim inventories somewhat in the near future . Housing Strong momentum continued in construction activity with builders reporting that housing starts remained relatively high last month , and well above year-ago levels . Builders expect a seasonal flattening in construction activity in the coming months . While sales of new homes were up again , they grew at a slower pace than in the recent past . The consistently strong sales have left inventories of unsold new homes at low levels . Mortgage lenders reported that demand last month was generally unchanged , but remained well above year-ago levels . Home purchases continued to account for close to half of mortgage activity . Although less optimistic than in our previous survey , lenders expect mortgage demand to stay modestly strong over the next three months as rates remain low . Banking Bankers reported that loans and deposits both edged up last month , leaving loan-deposit ratios little changed .

Consumer loans , home mortgage loans , and agricultural loans increased , while other loan categories were generally unchanged . Increases in money market deposit accounts and large CDs accounted for the rise in deposits .",0.8,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:56:10.1043022Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.8\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 13, 41077, 350, 20684, 10942, 14919, 5702, 14616, 14138, 3746, 1537, 2254, 448, 10779, 10350, 518, 1550, 5866, 315, 8654, 659, 41077, 7236, 1033, 8789, 2500, 1154, 448, 1172, 978, 57639, 5904, 315, 31773, 12703, 304, 2990, 3039, 659, 92158, 2433, 1537, 2254, 1033, 10063, 1154, 323, 19680, 4961, 9519, 15650, 911, 862, 23689, 448, 1482, 5591, 5866, 659, 4354, 1154, 16621, 3119, 311, 11013, 17023, 2433, 14400, 304, 279, 3143, 3853, 659, 30333, 26099, 23270, 8570, 304, 8086, 5702, 448, 48086, 12827, 429, 11721, 8471, 14616, 12040, 1550, 1537, 2254, 1154, 323, 1632, 3403, 1042, 12, 6304, 5866, 659, 75748, 1720, 264, 35799, 51039, 6019, 304, 8086, 5702, 304, 279, 5001, 3951, 659, 5976, 6625, 315, 501, 10415, 1033, 705, 1549, 1154, 807, 13938, 518, 264, 28393, 17857, 1091, 304, 279, 3213, 3267, 659, 576, 20699, 3746, 6625, 614, 2115, 17023, 2433, 315, 6975, 813, 501, 10415, 518, 3347, 5866, 659, 47680, 45015, 4961, 429, 7479, 1537, 2254, 572, 8789, 34857, 1154, 714, 14616, 1632, 3403, 1042, 12, 6304, 5866, 659, 5379, 23491, 8570, 311, 2692, 369, 3265, 311, 4279, 315, 20846, 5702, 659, 10328, 2686, 35936, 1091, 304, 1039, 3681, 10572, 1154, 45015, 1720, 20846, 7479, 311, 4717, 26848, 398, 3746, 916, 279, 1790, 2326, 3951, 438, 7813, 7146, 3347, 659, 49499, 8547, 388, 4961, 429, 16606, 323, 33651, 2176, 89563, 705, 1537, 2254, 1154, 9380, 11679, 6810, 2724, 41238, 2632, 5497, 6762, 29968, 16606, 1154, 2114, 20846, 16606, 1154, 323, 28049, 16606, 7172, 1154, 1393, 1008, 11679, 11059, 1033, 8789, 34857, 659, 67048, 304, 3220, 3081, 16539, 9618, 323, 3460, 61337, 40753, 369, 279, 10000, 304, 33651, 659, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 23, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3443031400, 'load_duration': 29492800, 'prompt_eval_count': 325, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1004439000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2404139000}"

New trucks and SUVs remained the hottest sellers , however , and most dealers complained of shortages of these vehicles . Like most other retailers , auto dealers remain very optimistic about sales in the near future . Manufacturing Tenth District manufacturing activity held steady last month , albeit at a relatively weak level . Plants were operating at similar capacities - medium to high - as in our previous survey , but still well below levels posted a year ago . Manufacturing materials were generally available with lead times practically unchanged , and managers had little concern about availability in the near future . Factories began modestly increasing inventories in March and early April , and managers were happier with current stock levels than in the recent past . The increases were small , however , and most survey contacts anticipate having to trim inventories in coming months as stiff competition from low-price imports continues . Housing Construction activity remained strong last month , although housing starts in some parts of the district were slightly below last year 's pace . Nearly all builders expect even better performance in the months ahead .

487,"June 16 , 1999 District reports indicate that the U.S. economy remains strong , with gains in activity widespread . Retail activity in most districts has shown little sign of slowing , and consumers remain upbeat about the economy . Home furnishings and motor vehicles sold particularly well in April and May . Manufacturing activity continues to improve in most areas from the sluggish conditions of the past year and a half . Production of such items as electronics , machinery , heavy trucks , and construction equipment has been especially strong , although some sectors , such as steel and apparel , continue to face stiff competition from foreign producers . Construction continues to grow at a brisk pace throughout the nation , spurred by strong home sales in most parts of the country . Shortages of labor and materials , however , have resulted in higher building costs in some districts . Lending activity remains strong in most districts despite a slowdown in refinancings due to slightly higher mortgage rates . In the agricultural economy , growing and planting conditions have been mixed . There is little optimism about farm incomes in 1999 , as most agricultural commodity prices remain low . Energy activity in most regions has been slow to react to the recent increases in oil prices , although expectations of a solid recovery are high . Labor markets remain very tight in almost all districts , with increased reports of upward pressure on wages in many parts of the country .",0.95,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:57:25.3178155Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.95\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 27160, 220, 16, 21, 1154, 220, 16, 24, 24, 24, 10942, 6682, 13216, 429, 279, 547, 808, 13, 8584, 8458, 3746, 1154, 448, 19619, 304, 5702, 23782, 659, 34039, 5702, 304, 1429, 26438, 702, 6839, 2632, 1841, 315, 47308, 1154, 323, 13417, 7146, 84673, 911, 279, 8584, 659, 5379, 72171, 323, 8872, 11474, 6088, 7945, 1632, 304, 5813, 323, 3217, 659, 41077, 5702, 9539, 311, 7269, 304, 1429, 5671, 504, 279, 86946, 4682, 315, 279, 3267, 1042, 323, 264, 4279, 659, 24039, 315, 1741, 3589, 438, 30491, 1154, 25868, 1154, 8811, 26763, 1154, 323, 8086, 7096, 702, 1012, 5310, 3746, 1154, 7892, 1045, 25512, 1154, 1741, 438, 9509, 323, 54325, 1154, 3060, 311, 3579, 30061, 10707, 504, 7214, 23308, 659, 24026, 9539, 311, 3063, 518, 264, 74391, 17857, 6814, 279, 6995, 1154, 84647, 553, 3746, 2114, 6625, 304, 1429, 5479, 315, 279, 3146, 659, 10698, 1134, 315, 9327, 323, 7236, 1154, 4764, 1154, 614, 19006, 304, 5080, 4752, 7049, 304, 1045, 26438, 659, 444, 2459, 5702, 8458, 3746, 304, 1429, 26438, 8818, 264, 73917, 304, 59696, 1129, 819, 4152, 311, 10078, 5080, 20846, 7813, 659, 758, 279, 28049, 8584, 1154, 7826, 323, 47014, 4682, 614, 1012, 9519, 659, 2619, 374, 2632, 53408, 911, 8785, 45691, 304, 220, 16, 24, 24, 24, 1154, 438, 1429, 28049, 37883, 7576, 7146, 3347, 659, 12354, 5702, 304, 1429, 13604, 702, 1012, 6301, 311, 13767, 311, 279, 3213, 12703, 304, 5590, 7576, 1154, 7892, 16665, 315, 264, 6437, 13351, 525, 1550, 659, 14930, 11725, 7146, 1602, 10296, 304, 4558, 678, 26438, 1154, 448, 7172, 6682, 315, 39772, 7262, 389, 23123, 304, 1657, 5479, 315, 279, 3146, 659, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 24, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3661586900, 'load_duration': 12553400, 'prompt_eval_count': 326, 'prompt_eval_duration': 987412000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 2658945000}"
488,". Other Business Activity Regional purchasing managers ' surveys indicate steady growth in manufacturing activity in June and July , along with increased upward price pressures . New York purchasing managers report that manufacturing activity expanded at a brisk pace in both June and July , following a dip in May . Buffalo-area purchasers report that production activity grew at about the same modest pace in July as in the second quarter , while new orders and employment levels were little changed . Surveys in both these areas indicate a noticeable pickup in prices for manufacturing inputs . There have been reports of significant shipping delays due to the merger of Conrail into CSX and Norfolk Southern , though contacts do not see any problems comparable to last year 's merger between Union Pacific and Southern Pacific . One contact at a short-line railroad in upstate New York says that , while delays persisted in July , they were not as bad as in June ; conditions are expected to be back to normal by around the end of October . Some shipping has been diverted to trucks , but not much . Hotel occupancy rates in New York City held steady throughout the second quarter at just above 80 percent -- a high level but about 5 points lower than a year earlier . After registering double-digit increases through much of 1998 , room rates are currently running just 2 percent higher than a year ago .

489,"June 16 , 1999 The District 's economy continues to expand , though at a somewhat slower pace than in the last report . While there are scattered reports of upward price pressures , they appear to remain relatively subdued . Most retailers report that sales were above plan in May , despite unseasonably cool weather which held down sales of summer merchandise . Residential real estate markets remain strong , though activity appears to have leveled off in the second quarter , largely due to supply constraints . Regional purchasing managers report a slowdown in manufacturing activity in May , along with some upturn in input prices . The breakup of Conrail and its recent merger into CSX and Norfolk Southern appears to have caused only minor operational glitches thus far . Local banks report a dip in demand for residential mortgages and consumer loans , and continued improvement in delinquency rates . Consumer Spending Retailers report that sales were on or above plan in May , and would have been stronger still , except that unseasonably cool weather held down sales of summer merchandise . Overall , same-store sales for May were up by roughly 4 percent on average , though individual gains ranged from 2 to 8 percent .

Although retailers report mixed sales results for December , all experienced a strong pickup toward the end of the month , buoyed by cold weather and steep discounting ; inventories were generally said to be in good shape in early January . The housing market continued to gain momentum in the fourth quarter , led by a strong rebound in New York City 's co-op and condo market , continued brisk activity in the suburbs , and a marked recovery in sales activity in upstate New York .

493,"planning conservatively for the coming holiday season . Most do not anticipate the strong sales growth that they experienced in the fourth quarter of last year and do not want to be left with excessive inventories after the holidays . Notably , many retailers are reducing their apparel inventories relative to a year ago . Construction Evidence of a slowdown in the District 's single-family residential market continues to emerge . Buyer traffic has been down recently in many parts of the District , while inventories have risen somewhat and the use of price concessions has increased . Both builders and realtors noted that home sales had weakened in early October . Contacts anticipate continued moderate slowing in the housing sector through the remainder of the year . Commercial real estate activity remained strong , with vacancy rates declining slightly in most markets . However , several contractors around the District have reported that construction activity is slowing , backlogs are shrinking , and there have been net declines in occupied space in many areas . Industry experts indicate that the market remains well positioned in general , and there continues to be little risk of oversaturation in the near term . Manufacturing Contacts paint a mixed picture of recent factory activity . Military contracts and high-tech industries are continuing to stimulate manufacturing activity in the District .

Recent congressional approval for the purchase of F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft and C-1390J Airlifters is a positive development for Lockheed Martin 's Marietta , Georgia , plant .",0.2,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:57:46.5182465Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.2\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 500, 5947, 11110, 7887, 369, 279, 5001, 13257, 3200, 659, 7496, 653, 537, 47148, 279, 3746, 6625, 6513, 429, 807, 10321, 304, 279, 11737, 8338, 315, 1537, 1042, 323, 653, 537, 1366, 311, 387, 2115, 448, 26541, 17023, 2433, 1283, 279, 24421, 659, 2806, 2845, 1154, 1657, 29182, 525, 17719, 862, 54325, 17023, 2433, 8674, 311, 264, 1042, 4134, 659, 24026, 43696, 315, 264, 73917, 304, 279, 10942, 364, 82, 3175, 17190, 20057, 3081, 9539, 311, 32944, 659, 61078, 9442, 702, 1012, 1495, 5926, 304, 1657, 5479, 315, 279, 10942, 1154, 1393, 17023, 2433, 614, 40382, 14400, 323, 279, 990, 315, 3349, 61508, 702, 7172, 659, 11733, 48086, 323, 1931, 97166, 10342, 429, 2114, 6625, 1030, 57664, 304, 4124, 6527, 659, 46039, 47148, 8570, 23193, 47308, 304, 279, 11721, 10486, 1526, 279, 26313, 315, 279, 1042, 659, 27843, 1931, 12394, 5702, 14616, 3746, 1154, 448, 61462, 7813, 42748, 10078, 304, 1429, 11725, 659, 4354, 1154, 3807, 32740, 2163, 279, 10942, 614, 4961, 429, 8086, 5702, 374, 47308, 1154, 1182, 22081, 525, 62085, 1154, 323, 1052, 614, 1012, 4179, 56954, 304, 24367, 3550, 304, 1657, 5671, 659, 23840, 11647, 13216, 429, 279, 3081, 8458, 1632, 34228, 304, 4586, 1154, 323, 1052, 9539, 311, 387, 2632, 5214, 315, 17460, 266, 2017, 304, 279, 3143, 4647, 659, 41077, 46039, 6177, 264, 9519, 6802, 315, 3213, 8633, 5702, 659, 26960, 17080, 323, 1550, 41257, 19102, 525, 14354, 311, 49977, 14919, 5702, 304, 279, 10942, 6762, 25140, 30619, 14427, 369, 279, 7627, 315, 434, 12, 17, 17, 431, 32657, 24860, 14135, 323, 356, 12, 16, 18, 24, 15, 41, 362, 2811, 2085, 388, 374, 264, 6785, 4401, 369, 84136, 11565, 364, 82, 28729, 26527, 1154, 15893, 1154, 6008, 659, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 17, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3599391400, 'load_duration': 13044300, 'prompt_eval_count': 338, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1082471000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2501332000}"

Contacts with temporary staffing services suggested that demand for manufacturing workers dropped off notably in the last 6-8 weeks , and there were some new reports of manufacturing layoffs in some areas . A few contacts at tech consulting firms reported that more workers were `` sitting on the bench '' as many projects had been cancelled . Also , higher fuel prices drove many independent truck drivers out of business , making it easier for larger haulers to find qualified drivers . For the most part , however , contacts continued to find it difficult to hire and retain qualified workers . Again this holiday shopping season , retailers were challenged to adequately staff their stores and there appeared to be a more concerted effort to lure retirees back into the workplace .

Labor markets remained very tight , with wage pressures still evident but no higher than in previous surveys . Retail prices were unchanged , while prices for some construction and manufacturing materials continued to rise .

504,"January 19 , 2000 Reports from most Federal Reserve Districts indicated strong economic growth in December and early January . Economic activity was described as strong in most Federal Reserve Districts . Growth was characterized as solid in the Philadelphia and Kansas City Districts , and as moderate in the Districts of Atlanta and Chicago . Consumer spending growth was rapid during the holiday shopping period , and many retailers expect the high level of activity to continue into early 2000 . Manufacturing continued to expand in nearly every District and was broadly based across industries . Exceptions to this were in the food , apparel , agricultural equipment , and some construction-based industries . Residential real estate construction was mixed across regions , with the northeastern states experiencing an inventory shortage , the southern and midwestern states a slowdown , and the western states an expansion . Commercial construction activity varied across the country . Bank lending was mixed , with a decrease in mortgage lending that was often offset by increases in consumer and commercial lending . Labor markets remained tight in all Districts . However , the tight labor markets did not seem to be matched with large wage increases .

Bankers also reported that home mortgage refinancing activity has dropped as mortgage interest rates have risen . In contrast , purchase money mortgage lending has been rising , on balance , at banks in the region . Commercial bank lending officers anticipate that growth in business lending might ease as both lenders and borrowers become more cautious about leverage ratios and debt service burdens . However , bankers do not see any indications at this time of a slowdown in business activity in the region . Financial institutions involved in mortgage lending expect demand for purchase mortgages to slow eventually in response to recent increases in interest rates . Some banks that lend to builders and developers indicated that shortages of construction labor and land approved for development appear to be limiting the pace of home building in the region . Wages and Prices Manufacturers reported continuing increases in prices for raw materials and some manufactured inputs . The increases included but were not limited to energy resources and petroleum-based products .

514,"January 17 , 2001 Growth in economic activity in the Fourth District remained at the same slow rate described in our last report . The steel industry in particular continues to show a great deal of strain as a result of strong foreign competition and weaker domestic demand . Retail stores experienced a slower-than-expected holiday season , as consumer spending remained soft . However , labor markets have remained fairly buoyant , although less so than they had been earlier in the year . Industrial Activity The steel industry is facing some tough times . Mills are operating 10 to 30 percent below capacity , domestic demand has slowed , and there is intense competition from foreign producers , in part due to the strong dollar . Several firms have filed for chapter 11 , and more filings are expected . January orders are a little stronger than December 's , but first-quarter orders are expected to be weak . Producers of specialty steel are in a better position . While prices on specialty steel products decreased along with carbon steel , orders for specialty steel remain stronger . Consumer Spending Retail stores reported disappointing sales during the entire holiday season , with the lackluster performance extending across all categories . Retailers were forced to mark down many items to boost sales . Some did so as early as the first week of December . A discount retailer reported that at stores open at least a year , sales were down 1 percent from last year",-0.5,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T01:58:59.1478232Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": -0.5\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 32227, 220, 16, 22, 1154, 220, 17, 15, 15, 16, 33771, 304, 6955, 5702, 304, 279, 35074, 10942, 14616, 518, 279, 1852, 6301, 4379, 7481, 304, 1039, 1537, 1895, 659, 576, 9509, 4958, 304, 3953, 9539, 311, 1473, 264, 2244, 3484, 315, 25716, 438, 264, 1102, 315, 3746, 7214, 10707, 323, 42283, 12728, 7479, 659, 34039, 10533, 10321, 264, 28393, 47654, 12, 7325, 13257, 3200, 1154, 438, 11502, 10164, 14616, 8413, 659, 4354, 1154, 9327, 11725, 614, 14616, 14138, 74620, 517, 1154, 7892, 2686, 773, 1091, 807, 1030, 1012, 6788, 304, 279, 1042, 659, 24545, 14981, 576, 9509, 4958, 374, 12880, 1045, 11045, 3039, 659, 33102, 525, 10350, 220, 16, 15, 311, 220, 18, 15, 3266, 3685, 8654, 1154, 12728, 7479, 702, 47846, 1154, 323, 1052, 374, 18894, 10707, 504, 7214, 23308, 1154, 304, 949, 4152, 311, 279, 3746, 17692, 659, 25694, 18809, 614, 12729, 369, 12453, 220, 16, 16, 1154, 323, 803, 67148, 525, 3601, 659, 6058, 10163, 525, 264, 2632, 16245, 1091, 6652, 364, 82, 1154, 714, 1156, 57314, 10163, 525, 3601, 311, 387, 7469, 659, 1298, 33375, 315, 35874, 9509, 525, 304, 264, 2664, 2309, 659, 5976, 7576, 389, 35874, 9509, 3871, 24938, 3156, 448, 12499, 9509, 1154, 10163, 369, 35874, 9509, 7146, 16245, 659, 25197, 86653, 34039, 10533, 4961, 38123, 6625, 2337, 279, 4453, 13257, 3200, 1154, 448, 279, 6853, 75, 4993, 5068, 32359, 3941, 678, 11059, 659, 34039, 388, 1033, 9575, 311, 1868, 1495, 1657, 3589, 311, 7760, 6625, 659, 4329, 1521, 773, 438, 4124, 438, 279, 1156, 2003, 315, 6652, 659, 362, 11089, 36791, 4961, 429, 518, 10533, 1787, 518, 3245, 264, 1042, 1154, 6625, 1033, 1495, 220, 16, 3266, 504, 1537, 1042, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 1, 24512, 3819, 788, 481, 15, 13, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3252940900, 'load_duration': 11995000, 'prompt_eval_count': 333, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1017483000, 'eval_count': 12, 'eval_duration': 2220892000}"

However , auto sales surged in most of the district due to consumer incentives , and retail sales and housing activity rebounded somewhat from the dropoff following the terrorist attacks . In the farm economy , a dry autumn limited forage supplies and raised concerns about soil moisture going into winter . District labor markets continued to ease , as further job cuts took effect . Wage pressures also remained subdued . Price discounting at many stores held retail prices in check , and prices for finished factory goods edged lower due to weak demand . Prices for most construction and manufacturing materials were stable . Retail Sales Retail sales improved somewhat in late October and early November but remained close to year-ago levels in most areas . Large discount stores continued to enjoy the strongest sales . Most retailers were cautiously optimistic heading into the holiday shopping season , saying they expected to match or slightly exceed last year 's sales numbers . Home improvement stores were especially upbeat . Some retailers , however , reported they were aggressively managing inventories to avoid being stuck with excess stocks in January .

516,"November 28 , 2001 Reports from the Federal Reserve districts indicate that economic activity generally remained soft in October and the first half of November , with evidence of additional slowing in most regions outweighing signs of recovery in a few districts . Manufacturing activity weakened further , with declines in production , new orders and employment widely reported . Consumer spending was mixed—aggressive financing incentives drove automobile and light truck sales to exceptional levels , but tourism remained weak and nonauto sales were spotty , with stronger sales growth in some areas offset by weaker sales elsewhere . Retailers ' outlook for spending during the upcoming holiday season was also mixed . Store managers had already begun discounting prices in some areas to counteract weak customer traffic , while in other areas retailers ' expectations for the season had brightened recently . Residential real estate generally held its own , with sales of moderately-priced homes steady and permits for new construction increasing modestly in all but a few regions . In contrast , the demand for commercial space eased further , pushing vacancy rates higher and rents lower in many areas . In the finance sector , the pace of residential mortgage refinancing activity accelerated as mortgage interest rates fell further .

Despite recent easing in oil prices , contacts in the Dallas , Kansas City , and Minneapolis districts reported that oil and natural gas prices remain sufficiently high to promote continued expansion of exploration and production . However , Dallas and Kansas City reported that the pace of industry expansion is constrained by worker and equipment shortages . Given these shortages , the recent dramatic rise in natural gas prices is not expected to produce a further acceleration in drilling activity . Other extraction industries are not doing as well , as metal mining and processing activity in the Minneapolis district continued to decline in the face of falling commodity prices and high electricity costs . In the farm economy , the onset of winter weather across the country has had mixed effects . Minneapolis reported that moisture from heavy snowfalls has benefited the winter wheat crop and is expected to reduce the likelihood of drought conditions in the coming growing season . However , severe winter weather also contributed to a worsening in pasture conditions for livestock and an increased use of alternative forages in the Richmond , Minneapolis , Kansas City , and Dallas districts . The alternative supplies seem to be generally available except for some reports of hay shortages in the Dallas district .

Demand for trucking services has softened considerably , while fuel , insurance and labor costs have risen significantly . Many firms have imposed fuel surcharges on customers , but these are being limited by the threat of competition from railroads . With more trucking firm bankruptcies in 2000 than in a number of years , there has been a sharp increase in truck repossessions , which has , in turn , created a glut of used trucks and a drop in prices .

Manufacturing Typically , manufacturing conditions are similar throughout the District , but this year growth rates appear erratic between the northern and southern parts of the District . The northern region , which had reported deceleration in growth and only modest improvement in the last report , experienced strong growth during this survey period . Although the southern area reported strong growth in April , reports suggested a slight contraction in May . Conditions throughout the District have fluctuated monthly between contraction and expansion . Automakers in the District reported significant amounts of overtime , with one plant reporting overtime during all seven weeks beginning April 15 , two reporting six weeks with overtime activity , and another reporting five weeks with overtime . No plants reported closing during the last half of April or the month of May . In the steel industry , reports ranged from `` fairly strong '' to `` very slow '' activity . In general , steelmakers that supply materials and parts to automakers reported strong conditions ; those that supply construction companies reported stable conditions ; and those that sell to others reported poor conditions ( others include oil , tubular goods , commercial aerospace , and power generation companies ) .

While steel producers still reported excess capacity in the industry , area contacts noted that capacity utilization has increased for most area plants .

Manufacturing activity remained generally weak but appeared to have improved further from our last report . Bankers continued to report strong mortgage demand from households and weak loan demand from businesses . There were a few new reports of input cost increases , particularly for energy , but prices at the retail level remained largely in check . District farmland values in 2002 posted the largest year-over-year gain since 1997 , even as concerns increased about the impact of drought and continued low dairy prices . Consumer Spending Overall consumer spending remained weak in January and February . Most retail contacts indicated that sales results in January fell short of their conservative expectations , although one national chain noted some slight improvement in February . Merchants said that sales of food and consumables were stronger than other items , particularly apparel . Inventories generally remained lean as retailers sought to tightly control stocks , although one merchant reported that inventories were rising faster than sales .

A contact in casual dining noted that sales had been softening since mid-January , in part because of bad weather and increased fears of terrorism .

Banks that did experience volume increases suggested that the gains were due to market share shifts rather than a general increase in demand . On balance , banks did not appear to be tightening standards on business loans , and there were a few reports that overall business loan quality had improved slightly . Prices and Employment Costs There were a few new reports of increasing input costs , but retail price increases remained largely subdued . Of particular concern to many contacts were rising prices of energy and inputs derived from petroleum . One contact said that prices for diesel fuel had risen to `` frighteningly high '' levels , which could potentially send some small freight carriers into bankruptcy . By contrast , steel prices were said to be stabilizing after some significant increases in 2002 . There were no new reports of intensifying pressure on wages , and some companies were said to have delayed merit increases until later in the year . Businesses continued to express concern over rising health and other insurance costs . Despite some increases in input costs , fierce price competition kept most output prices in check . Small-business owners appeared particularly concerned with this trend , as they were finding it increasingly difficult to compete with larger producers on price .

Though most contacts could not immediately discern the total impact , retail and manufacturing experienced the greatest impact as a result of closures . Other sectors of the economy experienced minor or no problems due to the electricity problems . Manufacturing Most manufacturing contacts reported continued improving conditions in July and August . However , unlike the previous report , a few contacts did note declines in both production and sales . Overall , both production and sales were higher during this period than in the most recent report and during the same time last year , with nondurable goods manufacturers generally citing more favorable conditions than durable goods producers . Inventory levels were flat during this time period , with idle capacity remaining relatively the same as well . While most manufacturers said they were maintaining their current workforce levels , the proportion of firms reporting new hires was greater than those cutting payrolls . Most contacts still anticipate moderate sales and production growth by year 's end . Auto production fell again at most District plants in July and early August compared with June , but it should be noted that many facilities re-tooled in early July . Regardless , same-model production was about 4 percent lower than 2002 levels . In July , three new models began production in the District . A few facilities reported the use of overtime .

In the steel industry , production was fairly stable between July and August ,",0.5,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:00:51.7704165Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": 0.5\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 16123, 11495, 553, 279, 96404, 304, 5099, 61635, 590, 659, 17594, 1429, 18508, 1410, 537, 7069, 41545, 279, 2790, 5421, 1154, 10806, 323, 14919, 10321, 279, 12196, 5421, 438, 264, 1102, 315, 59900, 659, 6944, 25512, 315, 279, 8584, 10321, 8922, 476, 902, 5322, 4152, 311, 279, 17728, 5322, 659, 41077, 7496, 14919, 18508, 4961, 8570, 18392, 4682, 304, 5768, 323, 6156, 659, 4354, 1154, 19836, 279, 3681, 1895, 1154, 264, 2421, 18508, 1521, 5185, 56954, 304, 2176, 5670, 323, 6625, 659, 27893, 1154, 2176, 5670, 323, 6625, 1033, 5080, 2337, 419, 4168, 1091, 304, 279, 1429, 3213, 1895, 323, 2337, 279, 1852, 882, 1537, 1042, 1154, 448, 73898, 18329, 11561, 16621, 8789, 32164, 803, 36749, 4682, 1091, 26128, 11561, 23308, 659, 28126, 5866, 1033, 10063, 2337, 419, 882, 4168, 1154, 448, 27647, 8654, 9664, 12040, 279, 1852, 438, 1632, 659, 5976, 1429, 16621, 1053, 807, 1033, 20337, 862, 1482, 30927, 5866, 1154, 279, 21117, 315, 18809, 12827, 501, 71941, 572, 7046, 1091, 1846, 14376, 2291, 38274, 659, 7496, 18508, 2058, 47148, 23193, 6625, 323, 5670, 6513, 553, 1042, 364, 82, 835, 659, 8979, 5670, 11052, 1549, 518, 1429, 10942, 10779, 304, 5768, 323, 4124, 6156, 7707, 448, 5534, 1154, 714, 432, 1265, 387, 10342, 429, 1657, 12786, 312, 4686, 41731, 304, 4124, 5768, 659, 43740, 1154, 1852, 28244, 5670, 572, 911, 220, 19, 3266, 4722, 1091, 220, 17, 15, 15, 17, 5866, 659, 758, 5768, 1154, 2326, 501, 4119, 6009, 5670, 304, 279, 10942, 659, 362, 2421, 12786, 4961, 279, 990, 315, 38499, 6762, 641, 279, 9509, 4958, 1154, 5670, 572, 14138, 15175, 1948, 5768, 323, 6156, 1154, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 1, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3194191800, 'load_duration': 13895600, 'prompt_eval_count': 323, 'prompt_eval_duration': 986092000, 'eval_count': 12, 'eval_duration': 2191948000}"

Construction The pace of residential construction continued to weaken slightly throughout the District , even after accounting for the typical seasonal slowing . Reports of declines in activity were particularly prominent in the Cincinnati area . Building also appeared to be down for most firms on a year-over-year basis . Nevertheless , nearly half of the firms contacted continued to expect their sales in 2004 to ultimately surpass those seen in 2003 . Contractors ' costs for most materials declined throughout the fall , but often are still above their levels from a year ago . Increases in cement and concrete prices have also been reported . Finally , firms that were expanding planned to continue to add to their staffs . After recent reports indicated better business conditions for nonresidential builders , activity appeared to slow in the six weeks through the middle of November . However , many contacts attributed this to a normal seasonal slowing .

Similarly , in Manhattan 's co-op and condo market , selling prices per square foot were up 4 percent to 5 percent from the second quarter and up 15 percent from a year earlier ; the volume of transactions was up marginally , though contacts report that this is partly a function of a low inventory of homes on the market . Manhattan 's rental market has been generally stable since the last report : one contact reports that , following a dip in the second half of September , leasing activity has picked up again in October -- particularly at the high end -- though rents remain flat .

Some retailers cite recent reductions in consumer spending resulting from high gasoline prices , which they predicted earlier , but had not yet observed six or 12 weeks ago . Manufacturers are facing cost increases , but vary considerably in their ability to raise their own prices . Residential real estate markets in New England are becoming `` more reasonable '' as they cool slightly from record highs . Retail Retail respondents in the First District report mixed results for the quarter ending in September . While the quarter 's sales were mostly ahead of year-earlier levels , several contacts note a marked slowdown in the closing weeks . According to one contact in the apparel industry , same-store sales were up more than 4 percent in the third quarter partly due to better merchandising decisions , but year-to-date sales are virtually unchanged from last year . Another apparel contact noted that same-store sales were either up marginally or flat compared with a year ago in the months of August and September , with overall year-to-date sales still up just slightly from last year . Both respondents emphasized the negative impact skyrocketing fuel prices are having and threaten to continue to have on consumer spending .

Several Districts characterized the overall pace of economic growth as `` moderate '' or `` modest , '' although San Francisco reported that its economic expansion remained `` solid '' and Atlanta and St. Louis described overall conditions as `` mixed . '' The Philadelphia , Cleveland , Richmond , Chicago , Dallas , and San Francisco reports each highlighted a decline in the overall rate of economic growth in their Districts . Most reports on retail sales indicated slightly weaker conditions , on balance , than earlier in the year . But tourist spending remained robust , albeit with evidence of slower growth in some areas , and activity expanded for providers of nonfinancial services to businesses and consumers . Reports from the manufacturing sector were strong , with significant gains in output and sales , especially for durable goods .

Most Districts reported that retailers expect growth in retail sales to be modest at best relative to last year , and retailers generally were described as having a `` cautious '' attitude about the upcoming holiday season . Consistent with this assessment , the Richmond , Dallas , and San Francisco Districts reported early-season price discounting by retailers . In the Boston and Minneapolis Districts , retailers expressed cautious optimism for holiday sales , but they generally expect consumer spending to weaken in 2008 . Several reports indicated that retail inventories have risen a bit of late and were higher than desired levels during the survey period . Activity in the travel and tourism sector generally was at a high level and increased further in some cases . The Richmond , Minneapolis , and Kansas City Districts reported that tourist bookings grew or were above normal seasonal expectations during the survey period , and tourism activity in New York City remained at a high level .

In the metropolitan areas of Boston , Hartford , and Providence , office rent growth appears close to zero after concessions are taken into account . The industrial property market has been very weak in both Connecticut and Rhode Island -- in the latter case , vacancies are up and rents are down ( both modestly ) compared to last year . Sales activity is limited as credit remains very tight and buyers and sellers hold out for their preferred prices . Investment sales and new construction have been hit particularly hard . For example , three major building projects in downtown Boston ( office and mixed-use high rises ) are said to be currently languishing as they scramble to obtain tenant commitments and financing . As evidence that property valuations have fallen relative to operating incomes , sources report that capitalization rates for commercial property in greater Boston are now approaching 7 percent , up from last summer 's estimated 5 percent . Despite enjoying brisk business and high commercial mortgage interest rates , a small Boston mutual bank foresees that it could run up against lending capacity constraints before year 's end . Accordingly , lending officers at the bank have been instructed to adopt a `` more selective '' stance .

Conditions in the commercial paper market were noted to have improved , although one contact stated that difficulties were starting to appear for nonfinancial firms . Contacts also indicated greater liquidity in the credit default swap market , but that the net cost of capital had increased as credit risk continued to boost borrowing spreads . Prices and Costs Material and energy prices moderated from the previous reporting period . Several contacts noted declines in gasoline , steel , and scrap prices . In contrast , price increases were reported for concrete , plastics , and shipping containers . Fuel surcharges also continued to be of concern as the price of diesel fuel remained elevated . Contacts also reported that despite recent declines in raw materials prices , some costs remained elevated due to contracts signed earlier in the year . Wage pressures were limited , with some downward impetus reported . Pass-through of previous input price increases to downstream prices continued ; albeit to a lesser degree , with several contacts in retail trade lowering prices in response to weaker demand . Agriculture The soybean harvest finished in the District , but the corn harvest experienced delays due to precipitation , especially in Iowa .

Soybean yields were down from a year ago , although overall output was higher due to the shift in acreage planted toward beans .

658,". There were also several reports of pass-through of these higher costs to downstream prices , albeit to a very limited extent for industries such as residential construction and retail trade . In the financial sector , several contacts in the mortgage industry reported pressure on margins for residential mortgages from recent pricing increases in the secondary market . Wage pressures remained limited outside of skilled labor positions that continue to experience shortages . Agriculture Crop conditions improved in the District as sufficient moisture remained from earlier rains to offset dry weather in August . Replanted fields may boost soybean production above current published estimates . Contacts reported that corn and soybean fields were at least two weeks behind the typical stages of development , making crop yields more vulnerable than usual to an early frost . Concerns about risks for 2009 grew as farmers faced higher planting costs while having fewer options to lock in prices for their crops . These circumstances have led parties in transactions to more fully investigate the financial health of their counterparties . Hay supplies improved with new cuttings , and pastures were in good shape . Corn and soybean prices fell during the reporting period . However , livestock producers still struggled with high feed costs . Hog producers benefited from higher hog prices .

Lower corn prices eased margins for several ethanol producers reducing delays and allowing some new plants to start production .",0.2,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:07:14.0932305Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.2\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 13, 2619, 1033, 1083, 3807, 6682, 315, 1494, 42747, 315, 1493, 5080, 7049, 311, 51352, 7576, 1154, 42069, 311, 264, 1602, 7199, 12818, 369, 19102, 1741, 438, 20057, 8086, 323, 10806, 6559, 659, 758, 279, 5896, 10486, 1154, 3807, 18508, 304, 279, 20846, 4958, 4961, 7262, 389, 36582, 369, 20057, 60898, 504, 3213, 21219, 12703, 304, 279, 14246, 3081, 659, 94437, 39750, 14616, 7199, 4889, 315, 25530, 9327, 9892, 429, 3060, 311, 3139, 66176, 659, 36863, 67320, 4682, 12944, 304, 279, 10942, 438, 14016, 31157, 14616, 504, 6788, 61455, 311, 4347, 9058, 9104, 304, 6156, 659, 1032, 500, 7566, 5043, 1231, 7760, 28739, 17479, 5670, 3403, 1482, 4652, 17530, 659, 46039, 4961, 429, 13776, 323, 28739, 17479, 5043, 1033, 518, 3245, 1378, 5555, 4815, 279, 14260, 17628, 315, 4401, 1154, 3259, 19097, 35408, 803, 19563, 1091, 13475, 311, 458, 4124, 44734, 659, 51247, 82, 911, 15276, 369, 220, 17, 15, 15, 24, 13938, 438, 20336, 16601, 5080, 47014, 7049, 1393, 3432, 16745, 2606, 311, 5296, 304, 7576, 369, 862, 30565, 659, 4220, 13161, 614, 6069, 9677, 304, 14131, 311, 803, 7225, 19314, 279, 5896, 2820, 315, 862, 44016, 550, 659, 17798, 16720, 12944, 448, 501, 3931, 2065, 1154, 323, 3267, 1413, 1033, 304, 1661, 6083, 659, 21330, 323, 28739, 17479, 7576, 11052, 2337, 279, 12827, 4168, 659, 4354, 1154, 50776, 23308, 2058, 27115, 448, 1550, 5395, 7049, 659, 49769, 23308, 55028, 504, 5080, 45925, 7576, 6762, 9053, 13776, 7576, 94882, 36582, 369, 3807, 61672, 23308, 17719, 31074, 323, 10693, 1045, 501, 10779, 311, 1191, 5670, 659, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 17, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3497861900, 'load_duration': 13232500, 'prompt_eval_count': 310, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1004397000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2478090000}"
659,"July 23 , 2008 Economic activity in the Seventh District was sluggish in June . Consumer spending was mixed and labor market conditions weakened some , although they continued to vary by location . Residential construction declined further and nonresidential construction showed signs of slowing . Manufacturing activity weakened slightly . Consumer lending declined , while business lending was stable . Cost pressures from rising material and energy prices remained high , while wage pressures continued to be low . Flooding and cool weather further set back crop conditions in June , although they improved toward the end of the month and in early July . Consumer Spending Consumer spending was mixed since the previous reporting period . Federal tax rebates and increased discounting boosted retail sales , but spending on automobiles slowed . Consumers continued to tighten their budgets in response to higher food and energy prices . Spending on discretionary items such as furniture , apparel , and electronics decreased and gasoline consumption fell , while food service sales were flat . Higher fuel prices discouraged travel , leading to a slowdown in tourism . Tourism was also adversely affected by inclement weather and flooding in some areas of the District .

Demand slowly returned to some markets as inquiries were reported to have increased , particularly among first-time home buyers . However , many potential buyers were finding it difficult to obtain a mortgage . Nonresidential development and construction steadily increased outside of Michigan , reflecting mostly major infrastructure projects . Several contacts noted that declining credit availability for medium- and large-scale projects , such as hotels , was significantly reducing the project pipeline and would be limiting growth going forward . Manufacturing Manufacturing activity in the District weakened slightly from the previous reporting period ; but , overall , business conditions remained favorable . Activity continued to be robust in the domestic steel industry . Production was running near full capacity and contacts in several downstream industries reported limited availability of steel-related materials . Demand for heavy machinery in areas such as large-scale agriculture , oil and gas extraction , mining , and aircraft also remained strong . Export-oriented industries continued to flourish , with many contacts citing advantageous terms of trade . However , demand continued to be soft for manufacturers with close ties to residential housing , particularly the building materials and home appliance industries .

Automakers reported domestic sales were below expectations as price discounts were insufficient to move larger vehicles .

A contact in the construction industry reported that wallboard prices had declined to the degree that they no longer covered production costs . Many contacts cited the rising price of steel as a significant factor in their costs . Wage pressures were limited outside of the skilled labor positions that continue to experience shortages . A staffing firm reported some recent softening in pay rates for temporary services employment . In contrast , a construction contact cited union wage contracts and a manufacturing contact indicated health care as factors boosting their respective labor costs . Agriculture During March and early April , corn prices climbed to new highs ( in nominal terms ) while soybean prices retreated from recent highs . Contacts reported that these price developments may result in a smaller decline in corn planting and a more modest increase in soybean acres this spring than had been anticipated . For both corn and soybeans , substantially higher input costs , including premiums for crop insurance , have increased breakeven prices for the current growing season .

Residential construction remains weak , with no improvement expected going into 2009 . Most commercial builders told us that business is steady ; however , a growing number of them reported a decline in inquiries . Sales by District retailers showed a small improvement during July . Demand for business loans was relatively stable , while lending to households was flat to declining . Energy production was steady to increasing . And the market for freight transport services has softened . Employment levels were largely unchanged and wage pressures were limited to energy producers . Staffing firms saw a small increase in the number of job openings and job seekers . Job vacancies were greatest in health care and high-skilled manufacturing . Accounts of rising input prices , especially for metals and petroleum-based products , were widespread . However , we heard a few reports that the rate of increase in commodity prices is moderating . Manufacturing Output by District factories was largely stable during the past six weeks . Reports of shifting production levels were attributed to seasonal factors or shrinking demand by the housing and auto industries .

Reports from factories indicated that production was flat or up slightly , with increases being attributed to new orders and seasonal demand . New home sales proceeded at a slow pace , while commercial and industrial construction was very sluggish . Financing remains a major issue for residential and commercial builders . Sales by District retailers and auto dealers were generally flat . Declines in coal production have leveled out , with oil and gas output holding steady . Reports indicated little change in freight transport volume . Business and consumer lending weakened further , while core deposits continued to grow . Large scale employment reductions have flattened out across most sectors , with some companies recalling a small number of workers . Staffing firm representatives reported an uptick in job openings across a wide spectrum of industries . Given the weak labor market , wage pressures are contained . We heard many reports of fluctuating commodity prices , especially from manufacturers and food producers . Otherwise , construction materials and product pricing were relatively stable . Capital spending and inventories remain under very tight control .

Still volumes remain well below year-ago levels . Intermodal cargo volumes rose slightly over the past month as export demand improved , and contacts said water-based container trade volume increased . Railroad respondents said volumes declined across the board following a pickup noted in the last survey .

Among factors cited for the increase were a continued flight to quality , a desire by investors to park their cash on the sidelines , and an easing in rate competition from troubled institutions . Energy Energy activity edged up in September and early October but remained considerably below year-ago levels . Overall drilling activity improved slightly over the previous month , mainly among crude oil producers , and activity was expected to remain stable . However , rig counts were still at low levels historically , particularly for natural gas in Colorado and Oklahoma . Natural gas prices remained subdued due to record supplies in storage . However , many producers expected price increases in the coming cold winter months . Agriculture Since the last survey period , the prospects of a bumper crop limited agricultural commodity prices and pushed down farm income expectations . The majority of the corn and soybean crops were reported in good or better condition . Farmers anticipated above average yields , although delayed spring planting has set back the harvest .

Reduced global demand and lower prices for oil have prompted a sharp cutback in oil extraction activity since last fall , with Dallas noting an `` unprecedented '' decline in the domestic rig count that was largely concentrated in their District . Respondents from the Kansas City District expect oil extraction activity to fall further as the year proceeds , and Minneapolis noted that natural gas and mining activities also faltered during the reporting period . Prices and Wages Upward price pressures were very limited during the reporting period , as a result of lower energy and commodity prices and weak demand for final goods and services across a wide range of sectors . The lower prices of energy and raw materials generally were passed on and contributed to downward pressure on the final prices of various products , according to Chicago and Dallas . Prices dropped on selected retail items in the Philadelphia , Kansas City , and San Francisco Districts , as discounting was widespread . Selected food products were a notable exception to downward price pressures , with Philadelphia reporting that some food processors raised their product prices . Gas prices rose , but according to Chicago and San Francisco the increase was not large enough to substantially offset the ongoing effects of the net decline from last year 's highs .

Upward wage pressures eased in all Districts , as a rising incidence of hiring freezes and continued job cuts increased the degree of labor market slack .

San Francisco reported that despite some pickup in recent months , home sales continued to be quite slow in most parts of the District . In the New York District , the market for new homes continued to weaken in New Jersey , and the higher-priced housing markets nearest to New York City were characterized as especially weak . While the Minneapolis District reported that late December saw an up-tick in residential sale activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area , it was reportedly driven by foreclosures and short sales . Increased home sale cancellations were common in a few Districts . Contacts in the Dallas District reported that home sale cancellations remained prevalent , in some cases outpacing sales . Elevated cancellation rates and weak showroom traffic in the Chicago District led developers to remain cautious about expanding inventory levels , and some building contractors in the Cleveland District reported increased inventories because of take-backs from home sales that fell through . Boston , Philadelphia , Atlanta , Kansas City , and San Francisco reported that home prices continued to soften or fall .

Transportation Freight transport executives reported steady to declining volume during the past six weeks . Still , bottom lines have improved for some carriers due to better pricing and higher productivity . Looking forward , carriers expect that any further volume decline will be modest , with a few anticipating a return to slow growth . Due to a drop in capacity attributed to carriers exiting the industry and the enactment of additional federal safety regulations , executives believe they will be able to successfully negotiate more favorable rates as demand rises . A few of our contacts reported rising prices for fuel . The cost of new tractors is substantially higher , while used equipment prices are falling . Capital outlays are expected to increase at a modest rate going into 2011 , with most monies allocated for equipment replacement .

This document summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials . Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that the economy continued to improve , on balance , during the reporting period from early/mid-October to mid-November . Economic activity in the Boston , Cleveland , Atlanta , Dallas , and San Francisco Districts increased at a slight to modest pace , while a somewhat stronger pace of economic activity was seen in New York , Richmond , Chicago , Minneapolis , and Kansas City . Philadelphia and St. Louis reported business conditions as mixed . Manufacturing activity continued to expand in almost all Districts , with relatively strong growth seen in metal fabrication and the automotive industries . Reports also showed steady to increasing activity for professional and nonfinancial services . Two Districts noted a decline in demand from government agencies due to budgetary shortfalls . Reports on consumer spending tended to be positive . Nonetheless , several Districts noted that households remain price sensitive and focused on buying necessities .

Most retail contacts report that they hired somewhat more holiday season workers in 2010 than in 2009 .

Tourism activity in New York City has remained fairly brisk since the last report .

'' Another said that budget issues are leading to delays but not to reductions in sales . Raw material prices have stabilized overall but remain an issue . On the one hand , a plumbing manufacturer said that copper is `` on the march again . '' On the other hand , low natural gas prices have been a boon to U.S. industry . A contact in the industrial membrane industry reports that a multimillion dollar project to switch to natural gas has already led to millions of dollars in savings . A petrochemical contact points out that the equivalent price of natural gas in terms of oil is approximately $ 25 a barrel , making the U.S. a low cost producer of petrochemicals ; as he put it , we are `` exporting natural gas in the form of ethylene and polyethylene . '' All of our manufacturing contacts are increasing investment and none cites any issues finding financing . Remarkably , almost all of our contacts say they have acquired at least one company over the last six months . Almost all responding manufacturers report increased employment and there are fewer complaints about difficulties finding qualified workers than in the past ; at the same time , an equipment manufacturer is spending significant sums on training expenses for new hires .

Banking contacts reported modest growth in small business loan demand , but also slower growth in debt restructuring and leveraged finance deals as well as lower utilization of credit lines . Contacts attributed the decrease in credit demand from middle market customers to heightened uncertainty about future tax rates on capital spending . Loan pricing and standards remained broadly unchanged , with the exception of commercial and industrial and auto lending , where credit terms and availability continued to ease . Contacts noted that community and regional banks have been particularly aggressive in pricing and covenants to compete with larger banks for a limited supply of new loan opportunities . Prices and CostsCost pressures were little changed in October and early November . Several contacts noted that even though steel and scrap prices were lower than they were a few months ago , both had increased in recent weeks . A contact in the steel industry noted that the recent rise in scrap prices may reflect the impact of Hurricane Sandy as well as slightly higher global demand . Construction contacts also reported an increase in prices of raw materials such as lumber .

There were also modest signs of improvement in Westchester and Fairfield counties and in the Albany area , whereas office markets in northern New Jersey and western New York State appear to have slackened modestly . Industrial leasing markets were generally steady overall : conditions firmed in Long Island but showed some signs of softening across upstate New York ; in the rest of the District , conditions were little changed . Other Business Activity A major New York City employment agency reports that hiring activity has slowed somewhat since October , particularly in the financial services sector , but notes that it is difficult to gauge the underlying climate during this typically slow season . Contacts at major retail chains indicated that they hired more seasonal workers this year than last .

Manufacturing Since the last Beige Book , Third District manufacturers have reported virtually no change in shipments and just the slightest decline in new orders . Gains continue among the makers of food products , lumber and wood products , fabricated metals , industrial machinery , and instruments . Firms in the primary metals and electronic equipment industries report a fall-off in demand . According to various contacts , growth is attributed to warm weather , automotive demand , production returning from China , Marcellus Shale activity , and renewed customer optimism . About eight out of 10 Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve or stay the same during the next six months â€ “ somewhat less optimistic than reported in the last Beige Book . Except for primary metals , optimism is present in all major sectors . Firms seem relatively divided as to whether high energy costs are a concern , depending largely on their ability to pass the cost along to their customers . New to the list of concerns and uncertainties about the outlook is the increasing worry that political gridlock will lead to large cuts in defense-related production through sequestration . While caution remains , firms have reported a little more optimism as have their customers .

However , manufacturers have expressed somewhat lower expectations of future capital spending and future hiring since the last Beige Book .",0.5,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:12:26.9047652Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.5\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 26151, 288, 614, 57405, 264, 803, 25489, 13057, 389, 279, 9481, 315, 279, 1482, 13351, 323, 279, 15276, 311, 1181, 57119, 659, 41077, 8704, 279, 1537, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1154, 20861, 10942, 16621, 614, 4961, 21214, 902, 2297, 304, 58621, 323, 1101, 279, 59047, 17704, 304, 501, 10163, 659, 479, 1735, 3060, 4221, 279, 28314, 315, 3607, 3871, 1154, 61453, 323, 7579, 3871, 1154, 69454, 36082, 1154, 12785, 25868, 1154, 323, 23316, 659, 434, 14404, 304, 279, 6028, 36082, 323, 14346, 7096, 19102, 1895, 264, 4399, 12462, 304, 7479, 659, 10548, 311, 5257, 18508, 1154, 6513, 374, 29606, 311, 8205, 9104, 1154, 39408, 7479, 1154, 5670, 13451, 504, 5616, 1154, 2876, 5873, 355, 1417, 1574, 5702, 1154, 323, 35546, 6002, 53408, 659, 9975, 8063, 700, 315, 220, 16, 15, 20861, 10942, 16621, 1720, 2562, 4682, 311, 7269, 476, 4717, 279, 1852, 2337, 279, 1790, 4743, 3951, 27905, 15056, 1036, 14400, 2686, 35936, 1091, 4961, 304, 279, 1537, 2823, 7256, 5893, 659, 37167, 369, 6028, 36082, 1154, 53408, 374, 3042, 304, 678, 3598, 25512, 659, 434, 14404, 2803, 12040, 17779, 438, 311, 3425, 1550, 4802, 7049, 525, 264, 4643, 1154, 11649, 13771, 389, 862, 5726, 311, 1494, 279, 2783, 3156, 311, 862, 6310, 659, 1532, 311, 279, 1140, 315, 10520, 323, 68767, 911, 279, 35621, 374, 279, 7703, 10955, 429, 4948, 5827, 1023, 686, 2990, 311, 3460, 15104, 304, 9055, 13904, 5670, 1526, 511, 591, 54581, 659, 5976, 27830, 8458, 1154, 18809, 614, 4961, 264, 2632, 803, 53408, 438, 614, 862, 6310, 6762, 11209, 1154, 16621, 614, 13302, 14400, 4722, 16665, 315, 3853, 6722, 10164, 323, 3853, 23134, 2474, 279, 1537, 2823, 7256, 5893, 659, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3501497200, 'load_duration': 13495200, 'prompt_eval_count': 328, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1016936000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2468685000}"

Reports across sectors were generally positive and expectations for the coming months remained optimistic . Retail reports were mixed with some retailers citing improved sales and others feeling the pinch from a constrained consumer . Hospitality contacts reported healthy activity in both leisure and business travel . Homebuilders and brokers experienced further improvements in sales and prices of new and existing homes , and inventories continued to decline on a year-over-year basis . Commercial contractors noted a strong year to date as construction levels improved from late last year . Overall , manufacturing activity remained positive as new orders and production increased . Loan demand remained steady according to bankers . Payrolls continued to grow at a tepid pace as firms remained reluctant in hiring due to uncertainty over fiscal policy and healthcare reform . Prices remained stable and most firms continued to report having relatively little pricing power . Consumer Spending and TourismDistrict merchants reported mixed results from mid-February through March .

Several contacts indicated improvements in profit margins and sales over the last three months , while others noted that they experienced the result of consumers taking a hit with the expiration of the payroll tax cut , increased fuel prices , a delay in income tax refunds , and increased health insurance premiums . Yet , even with these challenges , most retailers remained reasonably upbeat .

Selected Business Services Consulting and advertising contacts report a strong third quarter , consistent with a sustainably , but not rapidly , growing economy . Healthcare consultants cite the strongest results , as the double-digit revenue growth of the past few years continues . Demand for healthcare consulting services is driven by increased merger and acquisition activity among providers , adoption of new technology , compliance with new regulations , and the need for organizational change due to structural shifts in the healthcare industry . Demand for economic consulting remains strong , and strategy consultants report that `` the economy is slowly picking up steam . '' Marketing contacts estimate industry-wide growth of 6 percent to 7 percent , driven by large corporate orders and a shift in demand towards higher-value items as companies have more to spend on marketing and branding . By contrast , a government consultant reports a slight drop in revenues and a smaller backlog as the sequester continues to reduce agencies ' ability to purchase services .

757,"rose throughout the First District in May . Contacts in the region report strong demand for housing , particularly in urban areas of New England . According to contacts , slight increases in interest rates will likely spur more buyer activity in the short term as households try to lock in historically low interest rates . In Massachusetts , particularly in the Greater Boston area , inventory levels remain low , placing upward pressure on prices . Contacts in the Greater Boston area caution that inventory remains the most significant constraint on sales growth . In other parts of the First District , smaller cities report depleting inventory levels in urban centers , though realtors in these areas feel that a sufficient number of homes are available to satisfy prospective buyers . In contrast to much of the region , Rhode Island maintains a high level of inventory , but that market appears to be recovering as sales activity and prices continue to increase .

Business confidence in southern Maine reportedly improved but no major expansions or hiring plans were announced .

760,". Real EstateSales of new and existing single-family homes trended higher and they were above year-ago levels . Our contacts attributed this trend to low interest rates , favorable prices , and an improving labor market . One builder commented that young people are less inclined to buy a house than were their parents due to a perceived lack of value and a desire for mobility . He believes that this reluctance may put downward pressure on the housing industry for years to come . New home contracts were found mostly in the mid- to higher-price-point categories . Demand for multifamily housing remains strong . Builders expressed confidence that the turnaround in the housing market will persist in the upcoming months . However , they cited difficulty in obtaining financing and low inventory as barriers to more robust growth in their industry . List prices of new homes increased by as much as 10 percent in certain markets this year due primarily to rising construction costs . Builders have cut back on discounting . Nonresidential builders told us that while inquiries have weakened , there were still a large number of projects in the development phase .

'' Real Estate and ConstructionHomebuilders throughout most of the Third District remained moderately busy with existing projects from spring sales . However , several builders reported a dip in traffic and new sales contracts in July , with modest sales growth resuming in early August . Higher interest rates were partly blamed for the lull : Locking in a mortgage rate now for an existing home appeared preferable to getting a mortgage later when the new home is completed . Sales of existing homes continued to grow at a moderate pace into August , according to residential brokers . A broker in the greater Philadelphia area described sales growth as `` good steady improvement , not soaring . '' Sales closed and sales pending grew by double digits ( year over year ) in some of the larger metropolitan areas in the Third District and by nearly double digits in a few others .

In particular , general services and commercial real estate leasing continued to expand at modest rates . Activity in staffing services , transportation services , and residential construction appear to have accelerated somewhat to a modest rate of growth . Sales of new and used autos maintained a moderate rate of growth -- joined by general retail sales that grew a bit faster than last period and by residential real estate sales that grew a bit slower . The manufacturing sector reversed course again , citing slight declines in overall demand . Lending volumes at Third District banks continued to grow slightly , and credit quality continued to improve . Ski resorts are enjoying a good season overall , while Atlantic City casino revenues continue to decline . General price levels , as well as wages and home prices , were reported to have increased slightly overall -- similar to the last Beige Book period . The overall outlook for modest growth remains the same as those views expressed in the last Beige Book . Ongoing uncertainty over fiscal issues has postponed many business decisions .

Contacts reported a fundamental optimism in the economy and described new signs of emerging growth ; however , the ongoing uncertainty over fiscal issues has been blamed for continued weak consumer confidence and reluctance of businesses to make needed investments in plant",0.5,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:13:51.99121Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.5\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 27523, 220, 21, 1154, 220, 17, 15, 16, 18, 56922, 2562, 5702, 304, 279, 20861, 10942, 702, 18401, 279, 26848, 17857, 315, 6513, 429, 572, 29476, 2337, 279, 3681, 2823, 7256, 5893, 4168, 659, 758, 3953, 1154, 4586, 3516, 323, 8353, 1931, 12394, 70319, 8570, 311, 9225, 518, 26848, 7813, 659, 14981, 304, 64051, 3516, 1154, 17903, 3516, 1154, 323, 20057, 8086, 4994, 311, 614, 48758, 14400, 311, 264, 26848, 4379, 315, 6513, 659, 15829, 315, 501, 323, 1483, 46872, 18401, 264, 23193, 4379, 315, 6513, 1177, 10859, 553, 4586, 10806, 6625, 429, 13938, 264, 2699, 10596, 1091, 1537, 4168, 323, 553, 20057, 1931, 12394, 6625, 429, 13938, 264, 2699, 28393, 659, 576, 14919, 10486, 27437, 3308, 1549, 1154, 32164, 8112, 56954, 304, 8084, 7479, 659, 444, 2459, 26282, 518, 20861, 10942, 13959, 8570, 311, 3063, 10078, 1154, 323, 6668, 4271, 8570, 311, 7269, 659, 60495, 60445, 525, 21413, 264, 1661, 3200, 8084, 1154, 1393, 22375, 4311, 11846, 29366, 3060, 311, 17704, 659, 3251, 3349, 5866, 1154, 438, 1632, 438, 23123, 323, 2114, 7576, 1154, 1033, 4961, 311, 614, 7172, 10078, 8084, 1177, 4428, 311, 279, 1537, 2823, 7256, 5893, 4168, 659, 576, 8084, 35621, 369, 26848, 6513, 8458, 279, 1852, 438, 1846, 6194, 13302, 304, 279, 1537, 2823, 7256, 5893, 659, 506, 85071, 26826, 916, 19743, 4714, 702, 61620, 1657, 2562, 11181, 6762, 36784, 4961, 264, 15811, 53408, 304, 279, 8584, 323, 7481, 501, 11929, 315, 23206, 6513, 2587, 4764, 1154, 279, 14195, 26826, 916, 19743, 4714, 702, 1012, 35097, 369, 8570, 7469, 11502, 12136, 323, 82950, 315, 9675, 311, 1281, 4362, 21786, 304, 6008, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 220, 330, 24512, 3819, 788, 220, 15, 13, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3508240200, 'load_duration': 25439800, 'prompt_eval_count': 320, 'prompt_eval_duration': 983259000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2497249000}"

In contrast , a real estate representative in Virginia indicated that office park absorption rates in the Roanoke suburbs were good , with ninety percent occupancy rates , which he attributed to new medical facilities . However , he noted that vacancies in the downtown area were considerably higher . Most sources also mentioned tightening of available office space , especially among Class A properties , due to lack of new construction . A Charlotte Realtor stated that leasing rates in the industrial sector continued to decline this year and noted little new development in the retail sector . Moreover , several realtors reported that rental rates were soft , noting that it was a `` tenant 's market . '' However , all contacts were in agreement that concessions were decreasing .

Contacts in New Hampshire and Rhode Island cite declines in sales of single family homes , while Massachusetts experienced no change , and respondents in Connecticut , Maine , and Vermont cite increases in sales relative to December 2012 . Scarce inventory is said to be the most significant constraint on the growth of sales , while uncertainty from new qualified mortgage rules and flood insurance reforms are also believed to be causing buyers to remain cautious about making offers . Contacts in Connecticut say that sales are being affected by weak consumer confidence and a shortage of stable employment opportunities . Median sale prices increased year-over-year in four of the six New England states , decreasing only in Connecticut and Vermont . In Massachusetts , particularly in the Greater Boston area , price appreciation driven by low inventory levels has become a concern as realtors caution that high prices could keep first time home buyers out of the market .

The weather conditions also had ripple effects for food suppliers , delivery workers , and wait staff . A contact estimates that restaurant revenues in the Boston area were down 30 percent to 40 percent during this period , reflecting lost traffic from corporate travelers , regional leisure travelers , and weekend business from local residents . Museums and other attractions were down 6 percent for 2015 : Q1 compared to 2014 : Q1 . The good news is that , on balance , corporate and leisure travel is expected to be up again in 2015 , leading to increases in room rates and occupancy rates in area hotels . Manufacturing and Related Services Eleven of twelve contacted manufacturers report higher sales than a year ago ; the exception was a maker of hardwood furniture which saw an 18 percent year-over-year decline in sales .

Just over two-thirds of hiring managers surveyed are actively seeking employees : They cited high sales , overworked staff , and need for different skills among the top reasons why .

Current capital expenditures continued to grow at a moderate pace , as did expectations for future spending . Outlays were primarily for replacing industrial and IT equipment . Hiring picked up to a moderate rate , and contacts expect hiring to continue at a moderate rate over the next six to twelve months . Many contacts noted that the labor market continues to tighten .

Contacts also indicated that competition continued to grow for lower-skilled workers .

At recent pricing and demand , the financial positions of many firms continued to deteriorate , particularly smaller firms .

Agriculture Soil moisture conditions remained healthy , with only 2 percent of Texas considered abnormally dry in February , compared with 56 percent last year in some level of drought . While prospects for 2016 crop production are strong , farmers face low prices and downward pressure on exports because of the strong dollar . Industry contacts said many producers will not be able to cover their production costs at the current crop price levels , and some have received calls from their lenders voicing concern .

Contacts reported that low prices and weakening demand will likely result in fewer cotton acres planted this year . Milk prices continued to drift unprofitably low , despite the supply disruption in the wake of winter storm Goliath , which killed roughly 30,000 dairy cows in West Texas and New Mexico .

Turnover was mixed across the region ; however , any time turnover occurred , firms pursued opportunities to increase operational efficiencies by evaluating whether to fold one job into another , replace position ( s ) with technology , and/or shift the salary towards training and development of other employees . Firms continued to implement various methods to attract and retain top talent , often in lieu of wage increases . Contacts shared that in addition to offering flexible work hours and locations , more vacation time , and training and education opportunities , they were increasingly focused on social responsibility initiatives and support systems to encourage work-life harmony . Some contacts indicated that these non-wage compensation mechanisms were losing their effectiveness , thus broad wage increases were expected in the near term . Some firms noted increased offerings of early retirement packages in an attempt to lower overall compensation costs ( replace higher-paid , tenured workers with technology or lower-paid , entry to mid-level workers ) .

867,"main issue is a shortage of drivers . Manufacturing respondents had a positive outlook . In general , contacts were increasing capital expenditures , although only one reported a major increase in spending ( to build a new plant in New Hampshire ) . Contacts said that it was too soon to determine the effect of the new tax code on capital spending . Staffing Services New England staffing firms have seen mostly negative results over the last quarter of 2017 and the start of 2018 , with the majority reporting revenue declines year-over-year . For most respondents , this reflects a low unemployment environment that has slowed hiring volumes and increased competition for the remaining labor supply . Some also remarked on the entry of new tech firms specializing in job posting sites , which has made it easier for companies to host job searches without using intermediaries . This has sparked experimentation as they look for ways to distinguish themselves through advertising , branding , improving online reviews , and increased attention to building relationships with potential talent . One respondent reported the temporary placement side of their business was the strongest , while most noted that few workers want temporary positions in the current labor market . All anticipate the continuation of a robust economy and expect to continue to work under the constraints of a tight labor market for the foreseeable future .

For firms that produce components , the costs of `` qualifying '' new suppliers usually exceed the benefits . Indirect costs of the tariffs were also significant . For example , one contact complained about having to hire consultants to change computer systems to track the cost of tariffs . Contacts said the US tariffs and foreign retaliation had weakened demand for their products . Firms that supply electronic components to capital goods manufacturers said investment demand had slowed because firms were delaying capital expenditure plans . One contact said the brief threat to impose 5 percent tariffs on Mexican goods significantly increased uncertainty because it meant that even with an agreement in place , new tariffs were still possible . In general , contacts said they were able to pass the tariff costs onto their customers . One contact reported that previous problems finding trucking capacity had ebbed . Five of seven contacts reported flat or reduced employment . A frozen fish manufacturer said it was unable to find workers . A manufacturer of electronic components said it had laid people off as a result of the tariffs , with headcount declining by about 10 percent .

For example , the firm had moved an assembly line from the U.S. to Germany because most of the components in the product came from China and making the product in Germany",-0.75,"{'model': 'qwen2', 'created_at': '2024-08-06T02:20:33.037924Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": -0.75\n}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [151644, 872, 198, 47866, 6955, 25975, 389, 264, 481, 16, 311, 220, 16, 5452, 448, 481, 16, 1660, 1429, 8225, 323, 220, 16, 1429, 6785, 369, 2701, 2823, 7256, 5893, 1467, 13, 3411, 279, 5456, 438, 264, 4718, 897, 448, 264, 1376, 315, 25975, 323, 4302, 770, 25, 715, 89347, 7049, 1154, 11046, 7479, 323, 5080, 26826, 311, 6559, 4842, 659, 46039, 1053, 432, 572, 11136, 2588, 476, 11997, 311, 35998, 311, 2477, 29553, 7346, 20350, 659, 1752, 18809, 429, 8193, 6813, 1154, 279, 7049, 315, 9902, 36114, 3355, 501, 20350, 5990, 12488, 279, 7567, 659, 2263, 1226, 7049, 315, 279, 43895, 1033, 1083, 5089, 659, 1752, 3110, 1154, 825, 3645, 33970, 911, 3432, 311, 17983, 49084, 311, 2297, 6366, 5942, 311, 3754, 279, 2783, 315, 43895, 659, 46039, 1053, 279, 2274, 43895, 323, 7214, 60349, 1030, 57664, 7479, 369, 862, 3871, 659, 434, 14404, 429, 8149, 14346, 6813, 311, 6722, 11561, 16621, 1053, 9162, 7479, 1030, 47846, 1576, 18809, 1033, 79330, 6722, 44326, 6649, 659, 3776, 3645, 1053, 279, 9814, 5899, 311, 32230, 220, 20, 3266, 43895, 389, 23279, 11561, 11941, 7172, 26826, 1576, 432, 8791, 429, 1496, 448, 458, 9128, 304, 1992, 1154, 501, 43895, 1033, 2058, 3204, 659, 758, 4586, 1154, 18508, 1053, 807, 1033, 2952, 311, 1494, 279, 60261, 7049, 8630, 862, 6310, 659, 3776, 3645, 4961, 429, 3681, 5322, 9271, 10855, 287, 8654, 1030, 24463, 2721, 659, 20924, 315, 8094, 18508, 4961, 10063, 476, 11046, 14402, 659, 362, 19690, 7640, 13963, 1053, 432, 572, 11889, 311, 1477, 7337, 659, 362, 13963, 315, 14346, 6813, 1053, 432, 1030, 17113, 1251, 1007, 438, 264, 1102, 315, 279, 43895, 1154, 448, 1968, 1830, 42748, 553, 911, 220, 16, 15, 3266, 6762, 2461, 3110, 1154, 279, 7474, 1030, 7726, 458, 14614, 1555, 504, 279, 547, 808, 13, 311, 9856, 1576, 1429, 315, 279, 6813, 304, 279, 1985, 3697, 504, 5616, 323, 3259, 279, 1985, 304, 9856, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198, 515, 1, 24512, 3819, 788, 481, 15, 13, 22, 20, 198, 92], 'total_duration': 3513560900, 'load_duration': 27029600, 'prompt_eval_count': 322, 'prompt_eval_duration': 986961000, 'eval_count': 13, 'eval_duration': 2495907000}"

905,"March 4 , 2020 Summary of Economic Activity First District firms continued to report increases in economic activity heading into 2020 . Retailers reported mixed but mostly positive results , while restaurateurs saw solid revenue gains . Most manufacturers experienced revenue increases ranging from mid single-digit percentages to more than 20 percent , but two respondents cited revenue declines , both attributed in part to disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak in China . Staffing firms continued to report moderate to strong revenue gains , although a couple cited slowing growth or fewer job requests compared with last year . Residential real estate markets remained tight in the region , with inventories of both homes and condos decreasing as sales and prices rose . Commercial real estate markets were mixed across sectors and locations . Outlooks continued to be positive , with the coronavirus and the presidential election cited as risk factors . Employment and Wages Labor markets in the First District remained tight . Retailers noted that minimum wages went up in some states ; those increases , in combination with a generally tight labor market , have pushed up operating costs . Employment increased year-over-year at five contacted manufacturing firms ; headcount was down modestly year-over-year at one manufacturer and flat at four .

Looking ahead , professional & business service firms expressed mild optimism about prospects for the months ahead , whereas leisure & hospitality firms expressed increased concern that conditions would deteriorate . Tourism , which had picked up somewhat in the previous reporting period , has more recently shown signs of weakening . A number of contacts attribute this to the recent wave of the pandemic across the nation and much of the world , as well as the onset of cold weather , which limits outdoor activities . An authority on New York City 's tourism sector noted that most recent visitations have been short haul trips . Hotel occupancy rates have been noticeably higher on weekends than weekdays but are still well below 50 percent , and room rates are down sharply . Many city hotels are picking up some of the slack with alternative uses , such as providing shelter for the homeless . Advance bookings for the holiday season suggest only a modest uptick . While tourism is expected to rebound noticeably in 2021 , it is projected to remain 25-30 percent below pre-pandemic levels , as the international and business segments are expected to lag . Real Estate and Construction Housing markets have continued to strengthen across much of the District .

Business operations increased incrementally , as COVID-19 caseloads remained at relatively low levels throughout the period . As firms recalled more of their workforce , net employment also grew modestly ; however , firms also continued to issue permanent layoffs . Some wage increases were noted among lower-paying jobs . Meanwhile , contacts reported ongoing difficulties attracting workers . Prices edged higher again amid continued spotty price spikes . Firms maintained modestly positive expectations for growth over the next six months ; however , uncertainty is extremely high , as contacts worried about the end of stimulus measures , pending layoffs , and an inevitable rise of evictions , foreclosures , and bankruptcies . Looming over all is the active presence of the coronavirus . Employment and Wages Employment increased modestly overall as firms stepped up hiring and recalling workers ; however , layoffs continued as well . Among firms in our COVID-19 survey , 25 percent reported that they had hired new workers in July , and 13 percent recalled furloughed workers . Meanwhile , about 6 percent of the firms had laid off workers permanently , and another 6 percent had furloughed workers .

However , at mid-August , a slightly greater percentage of firms reported that employment had declined over the month than had increased .

That said , a few contacts suggested that the availability of semiconductors , a key constraint in the production of many goods ( including autos ) , had increased somewhat over the prior two months . More firms reported higher selling prices since the last report . Approximately 65 percent of contacts said they increased prices over the prior two months , a share that has changed little over the past four reports . In most instances , firms suggested that they raised selling prices out of necessity to keep up with increased input costs . One restaurant owner said that she was trying to `` control every other aspect [ she ] can before raising prices . '' Several contacts who did not increase prices could not do so because they were bound by contracts . Some of these firms plan to include escalation clauses in the future . Consumer Spending Reports suggested that consumer spending increased modestly during the reporting period . General merchandisers and apparel retailers said that demand for goods remained strong , and they noted solid early holiday season sales . Hoteliers and restaurateurs reported continued improvement in activity , and one hospitality contact said that weddings and conferences that had been rescheduled from last year were taking place .

In addition , many firms , particularly those in construction , retail , and manufacturing , reported that delayed deliveries from suppliers and coronavirus-related employee outages constrained their output . Hiring activity was modest , even though customer demand improved , and wage pressures increased moderately . Nonlabor costs rose strongly as supply chain disruptions coincided with stronger demand for inputs . Selling prices rose moderately as firms attempted to keep up with mounting input costs . Looking ahead , contacts expected moderate improvement in customer demand over the next couple of months , and they expected stronger gains in the second half of the year as coronavirus vaccines are more widely distributed . Employment and Wages Staff levels increased modestly , on balance , and hiring activity cooled somewhat despite the pickup in business activity . Labor demand varied across sectors . In the freight sector , labor demand was especially strong , and many firms noted they would like to hire more drivers but experienced shortages .

Growth in the manufacturing and nonfinancial services sectors picked up in early February after stalling in January , while retail activity remained flat . Unprecedented winter storms and widespread power outages in mid-February severely disrupted economic activity , though the impact is mostly expected to be transitory . The housing market continued to be a bright spot , with vigorous new home construction . Overall loan volume decreased slightly , though real estate lending continued to rise . Energy activity improved further . Employment rose and wages increased moderately . Marked price increases were seen in the manufacturing and retail sectors , due in part to supply chain disruptions . Outlooks were generally positive , but uncertainty persisted . Employment and Wages Employment was up overall , with solid hiring continuing in manufacturing and service-sector hiring picking up in February after easing in January . Employment reports were mixed in the energy sector , with some reporting lingering layoffs and others reporting hiring to meet needs for drilling and completion activity .

However , activity in most sectors remained below levels observed prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic . Net employment appeared to rise slightly after falling slightly in the prior period . Positive wage and price growth trends increased to modest and moderate paces , respectively . Economic gains appeared to reflect waning COVID-19 cases and the relaxation of some business restrictions . However , firms continued to cite disruptions at production sites , consumer outlets , and along supply chains . Moreover , wintry weather conditions have constrained growth in several sectors . More than half of the firms expressed positive expectations for modest growth over the next six months – the percent broadened further among nonmanufacturing firms but narrowed among manufacturers . Employment and Wages Employment appeared to increase slightly overall – rebounding from a slight decrease in the prior period . The share of nonmanufacturing firms reporting employment increases for full-time employees just edged out those reporting decreases . Among the manufacturers , employment increases broadened to nearly one-third of the reporting firms , while reported job declines waned . Moreover , average hours worked rose for a larger share of all firms .

Despite substantial pay raises , contacts had mixed results in attracting or retaining workers . A few staffing agents expected wage growth for lower-paid workers to slow in the coming year , saying that businesses can not afford to pay much more . However , contacts expect wage pressures for higher-skilled workers to remain elevated . Prices Nonlabor input costs rose for most contacts . In a few instances , contacts noted that some costs , such as for steel , had stabilized or come down somewhat . However , such reports were the exceptions .

Discretionary and more interest rate sensitive consumption categories – such as travel and car purchases – declined at a rapid pace , while spending on non-discretionary consumption categories – such as food , energy , and healthcare – increased modestly . Community Conditions Low to moderate income ( LMI ) households in the Tenth District reported greater difficulty securing adequate childcare over the past few months . Contacts cited both a lack of availability and rising costs at childcare facilities as the major barriers faced by households seeking care . Insufficient childcare availability and unaffordability continued to hinder workforce participation among LMI households . Recent policy efforts to improve childcare availability – for example , a recent zoning reform in Wichita , Kansas increased maximum home daycare capacity from 10 to 12 children – have reportedly been more than offset by an acceleration of closures of childcare facilities . Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Manufacturing businesses reported that overall activity remained mostly unchanged over the past few weeks . Higher prices supported revenues , but measures of real activity , including production , backlogs , and new orders , declined moderately .

Durable goods manufacturers reported more severe declines in production and expectations . Growth among services businesses was mixed across sectors .

For example , a gaskets manufacturer was `` hunkering down '' and halted hiring and capital expenditures due to fears of a potential economic downturn . A plastics coater reported smaller orders because customers had less money due to increased food and energy costs . Ports and Transportation Demand was weak at Fifth District ports this period due to less than the usual seasonal rebound in volume ; imports were lower year-over-year and month-over-month . The decline in import volume was mainly due less consumer goods coming into the port . Exports were flat this period . Spot shipping rates have continued to decline and carriers were doing more blank sailings in recent weeks to limit capacity . Empties were still moving and containers were flowing smoothly at the ports ; turn times were good and container dwell times had returned to normal . Demand for airfreight was soft this period ; there was an especially sharp decline in international airfreight , both in terms of exports and imports .

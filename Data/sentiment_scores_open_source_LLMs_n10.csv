1,"June 17 , 1970 Summary of Findings Sixth District directors have mixed opinions about future business conditions . If any consensus exists , it is that the economy has not yet bottomed out and that recovery will be less than spectacular when it comes . According to directors ' reports and other sources of information , further weakening in sales , employment and production is likely . Department stores report lower volume and growing resistance to higher priced merchandise . Belt tightening by businesses has spread , and directors report many instances of slowdowns in capital spending . Employment and production cutbacks are common . Retail sales Department stores surveyed report no discernible shift from the `` upstairs '' to the `` bargain basement '' . However , customer resistance to higher priced brands has increased , with lower priced merchandise receiving the benefit . A canvass of merchants by one of our Branch offices indicated that they expect no improvement in sales within the near future . Regarding auto sales , distributors contacted report some shifting from larger cars to the compact sized , loaded with optional equipment . Rather than settling for a stripped-down version of a full-sized car , customers are purchasing lower priced equipment-packed models . Belt tightening A profit squeeze is causing many businesses to trim fat wherever possible . Reports of capital expenditures being reduced or stretched out have been coming from several sources .

2,"of jewelry manufacturers in southern Massachusetts and northern Rhode Island report that 1970 sales levels to date are brisk . The textile industry , concentrated in the same area , has experienced a dramatic increase in demand for products associated with home sewing , reflecting the heightened consumer cost consciousness noted elsewhere this year . The New England machine tool industry , on the other hand , continues in a severely depressed situation with no letup in sight . Several regional producers of chemical and mineral inputs into housing associated products ( e.g. , paints , carpets , linoleum , etc . ) now discern a turnaround in demand as having occurred four to eight weeks ago . Regional labor markets , as noted in earlier reports , are softer than they have been for some years . This easing apparently extends into both blue- and white-collar groups . The views of our academic consultants have perhaps converged same since earlier in the summer . Professor Paul Samuelson feels certain that the economic turnaround is behind us , and that the slowdown has been sufficiently mild that it will escape official NBER designation as a recession . '' As a weak contraction tends to be followed by a sluggish expansion , Samuelson expressed concern that the existent real GNP gap will widen further over the next four quarters .

Since a growth in real output of about 4 percent is necessary to avoid this , he concludes that authorities should permit a monetary expansion great enough",-0.3,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T14:47:56.0448396Z', 'response': '{\n""sentiment"": -0.3\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 974, 432, 809, 295, 719, 12012, 332, 414, 297, 14841, 16167, 322, 14622, 7861, 356, 7935, 3461, 393, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29900, 16538, 11174, 304, 2635, 526, 1506, 3873, 869, 450, 1426, 488, 13661, 1919, 14953, 630, 297, 278, 1021, 4038, 1919, 756, 18860, 263, 8541, 2454, 7910, 297, 9667, 363, 9316, 6942, 411, 3271, 409, 16958, 1919, 9432, 292, 278, 3171, 6419, 21691, 3438, 19861, 2264, 11682, 17551, 445, 1629, 869, 450, 1570, 5408, 4933, 5780, 13661, 1919, 373, 278, 916, 1361, 1919, 18172, 297, 263, 2775, 873, 316, 13120, 6434, 411, 694, 1235, 786, 297, 11126, 869, 21882, 14014, 1391, 22543, 310, 22233, 322, 1375, 13537, 10970, 964, 27261, 6942, 9316, 313, 321, 29889, 29887, 29889, 1919, 6788, 1372, 1919, 1559, 29886, 1691, 1919, 6276, 1772, 398, 1919, 2992, 869, 1723, 1286, 2313, 824, 263, 2507, 11316, 297, 9667, 408, 2534, 10761, 3023, 304, 9475, 11405, 8020, 869, 16208, 10212, 2791, 1691, 1919, 408, 11682, 297, 8859, 13676, 1919, 526, 577, 906, 1135, 896, 505, 1063, 363, 777, 2440, 869, 910, 2240, 292, 13229, 4988, 964, 1716, 7254, 29899, 322, 4796, 29899, 1054, 4675, 6471, 869, 450, 8386, 310, 1749, 21567, 8799, 1934, 505, 6060, 5486, 3192, 1021, 1951, 8859, 297, 278, 11801, 869, 11386, 3739, 15316, 1100, 23880, 3058, 393, 278, 17407, 2507, 11316, 338, 5742, 502, 1919, 322, 393, 278, 5232, 3204, 756, 1063, 18430, 286, 789, 393, 372, 674, 10169, 6221, 405, 13635, 2874, 362, 408, 263, 337, 985, 291, 869, 6629, 1094, 263, 8062, 6761, 428, 29867, 304, 367, 5643, 491, 263, 2243, 12981, 728, 13184, 1919, 15316, 1100, 13384, 5932, 393, 278, 1863, 296, 1855, 402, 25500, 17261, 674, 281, 3615, 4340, 975, 278, 2446, 3023, 439, 13868, 869, 13, 13, 23036, 263, 14321, 297, 1855, 1962, 310, 1048, 29871, 29946, 10151, 338, 5181, 304, 4772, 445, 1919, 540, 378, 27722, 393, 21142, 881, 14257, 263, 1601, 300, 653, 13184, 2107, 3307, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29908, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29941, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 774392000, 'load_duration': 4689200, 'prompt_eval_count': 371, 'prompt_eval_duration': 337043000, 'eval_count': 14, 'eval_duration': 430215000}",0.5,0.3,0.4,-0.5,-0.2,"{'1970 sales levels to date': -1, 'brisk': 0, 'dramatiic increase in demand for products associated with home sewing': 1, 'heightened consumer cost consciousness noted elsewhere this year': 1, 'industry concentrated in the same area': 0, 'severely deprecied situation with no letup in sight': 1, 'turnaround in demand as having occurred four to eight weeks ago': 1, 'easily extends into both blue- and white-collar groups': 1, 'slowdown has been sufficiently mild that it will escape official NBER designation as a recession': 0, 'weak contraction tends to be followed by a sluggish expansion': 1, 'as a weak contraction tends to be followed by a sluggish expansion': 0, 'sluggish expansion': 1, ""weakness in the academic consultants' views of the economic turnaround"": 1, 'the slowdown has been sufficiently mild that it will escape official NBER designation as a recession': 0, 'the views of our academic consultants have perhaps converged same since earlier in the summer': 1, 'Paul Samuelson feels certain that the economic turnaround is behind us': 1, 'the existing real GNP gap will widen further over the next four quarter': 1, 'monetairy expansion great enough to avoid this': 1, 'authorities should permit a monetary expansion great enough to avoid this': 1}",Positive,-0.5,0.3

Price increases for durable goods continue to be about as numerous as in recent months , and there is no clear evidence of a diminution of the rate of rise of prices of finished goods . Rising costs and unsatisfactory volume are causing transportation firms to push regulatory authorities for appreciable increases in rates in hopes of improving earnings . Job markets continue to soften as indicated by unemployment compensation claims , and reports of restricted hiring practices . Increasingly , skilled workers such as machinists , teachers , and other professional types are listed among those seeking work . Lists of unfilled job openings are the smallest since the early Sixties . Despite the improved labor supply picture , wage and pension demands continue large and are backed by militant worker organizations in state and local governments as well as in factories , utilities , and transportation companies . Local strikes are frequent and prolonged .

6,"July 15 , 1970 Economic activity in the Fourth District improved in June , partly reflecting the termination of major strikes . The results of our most recent survey of manufacturers indicate that a more than usual seasonal decline in business conditions may develop in July in the district , although the bunching of plant-wide shutdowns for vacations at this time of year makes the data unusually difficult to interpret . Our directors remain generally pessimistic about the near-term economic outlook , although some of the industrialists feel that economic conditions may be a little better now than in previous months . In response to our question about price developments , we received a few reports of price discounting , but the consensus of our directors and a limited sample of business economists in the district was that prices will remain firm because of strong upward wage pressures . The improvement in economic conditions in the district in June was largely the result of the resumption of production and shipments following work stoppages in the area . The seasonally adjusted rate of insured unemployment for the district declined in June , and at month-end was approximately halfway between the pre-trucking strike level of March and the peak reached in mid-May . Steel ingot production in the district recovered in June after having declined in April and May .

Three of the retailers expected a substantially heavier volume , eleven expected a slightly heavier volume , seven expected sales to be about the same as in the 1969 season , while only three felt sales might be slightly lighter this year . In the way of general comments , one retailer noted that consumer sentiment was low due to the economic situation but expected relief during the fourth quarter and early in 1971 . One noted that if the General Motors strike continued , plus the massive layoffs at Texas Instruments , Ling-Temco-Vought , General Dynamics and Ford , that holiday sales could be softer than are now anticipated . One retailer indicated he was taking a `` lean bull '' position and expected October through April to be very strong for retail sales .",0.45,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T14:47:59.9564034Z', 'response': '{\n  ""sentiment"": 0.45\n}\n', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 1333, 287, 29899, 6341, 414, 526, 1407, 9543, 310, 8666, 13888, 472, 445, 931, 869, 512, 10230, 411, 278, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29953, 29929, 8753, 22394, 4259, 1919, 278, 13638, 310, 3240, 737, 414, 8967, 393, 896, 2149, 263, 14200, 631, 7977, 310, 16538, 445, 1629, 869, 12753, 310, 278, 3240, 737, 414, 3806, 263, 23228, 368, 14200, 631, 7977, 1919, 28121, 3806, 263, 10029, 14200, 631, 7977, 1919, 9881, 3806, 16538, 304, 367, 1048, 278, 1021, 408, 297, 278, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29953, 29929, 4259, 1919, 1550, 871, 2211, 7091, 16538, 1795, 367, 10029, 301, 14643, 445, 1629, 869, 512, 278, 982, 310, 2498, 6589, 1919, 697, 3240, 737, 261, 11682, 393, 21691, 19688, 471, 4482, 2861, 304, 278, 17407, 6434, 541, 3806, 18892, 2645, 278, 11582, 12616, 322, 4688, 297, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29896, 869, 3118, 11682, 393, 565, 278, 4593, 7142, 943, 21283, 7572, 1919, 2298, 278, 20364, 6568, 22450, 472, 10319, 2799, 582, 1860, 1919, 365, 292, 29899, 5776, 1111, 29899, 29963, 1774, 1919, 4593, 22554, 1199, 322, 14601, 1919, 393, 8753, 22394, 16538, 1033, 367, 577, 906, 1135, 526, 1286, 23483, 630, 869, 3118, 3240, 737, 261, 18694, 540, 471, 5622, 263, 4954, 20793, 289, 913, 6629, 2602, 322, 3806, 5533, 1549, 3786, 304, 367, 1407, 4549, 363, 3240, 737, 16538, 869, 32007, 32001, 426, 13, 29871, 376, 18616, 2073, 1115, 29871, 29900, 29889, 29946, 29945, 13, 29913, 13], 'total_duration': 762819800, 'load_duration': 4666300, 'prompt_eval_count': 269, 'prompt_eval_duration': 250755000, 'eval_count': 16, 'eval_duration': 505395000}",0.55,0.5,0.2,-0.5,0.2,-1,-1,0.5,0.25
8,"October 14 , 1970 There is evidence that future growth in large CD 's at Tenth District banks will be less . There are indications also that business loan demand may be easing slightly . The labor situation in the Kansas City area has worsened as the construction strike—now in its seventh month—continues and the General Motors strike prevails at several large GM assembly plants . The reduction in output of feed grains and high feed-grain prices is likely to have an impact on the WPI and CPI within several months . Instead of providing a downward pressure on these indices which occurred from March to August , farm prices may again exert upward pressure later this year or early next year . Those large District banks which have actively sought large CD 's ( many have not ) have continued to attract substantial amounts of funds . Growth rates of outstanding CD 's have been comparable to those at large banks in New York City and Chicago . One peculiarity in the Tenth District has been that a significant amount of CD funds have come from state and local governmental units—about one-third of the total growth in CD 's . This source of funds would seem to be limited , so that future growth of CD 's may slow . Despite the rapid growth of CD ' s , most of the District banks so far have retained bank-affiliate commercial paper as a source of funds . One large Tulsa bank , however , is",-0.5,"{'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-08-05T14:48:00.6272023Z', 'response': '{""sentiment"": -0.5}', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [32010, 20535, 403, 17407, 19688, 373, 263, 448, 29896, 304, 29871, 29896, 6287, 411, 448, 29896, 1641, 1556, 8178, 322, 29871, 29896, 1556, 6374, 363, 1494, 1522, 2231, 6726, 1426, 29889, 7106, 278, 8158, 408, 263, 4663, 995, 411, 263, 1820, 310, 19688, 322, 3078, 1683, 29901, 29871, 13, 25375, 4950, 29871, 29896, 29946, 1919, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29900, 1670, 338, 10757, 393, 5434, 14321, 297, 2919, 7307, 525, 29879, 472, 323, 9097, 7457, 24388, 674, 367, 3109, 869, 1670, 526, 4221, 800, 884, 393, 5381, 24806, 9667, 1122, 367, 2240, 292, 10029, 869, 450, 10212, 6434, 297, 278, 20029, 4412, 4038, 756, 281, 943, 6419, 408, 278, 7632, 21283, 30003, 3707, 297, 967, 16741, 29882, 4098, 30003, 1285, 262, 1041, 322, 278, 4593, 7142, 943, 21283, 12379, 2234, 472, 3196, 2919, 402, 29924, 11470, 18577, 869, 450, 20376, 297, 1962, 310, 8343, 2646, 1144, 322, 1880, 8343, 29899, 3874, 262, 26094, 338, 5517, 304, 505, 385, 10879, 373, 278, 399, 2227, 322, 315, 2227, 2629, 3196, 7378, 869, 8669, 310, 13138, 263, 1623, 1328, 12959, 373, 1438, 16285, 607, 10761, 515, 4779, 304, 3111, 1919, 17888, 26094, 1122, 1449, 429, 814, 701, 1328, 12959, 2678, 445, 1629, 470, 4688, 2446, 1629, 869, 16025, 2919, 7457, 24388, 607, 505, 1044, 3598, 18365, 2919, 7307, 525, 29879, 313, 1784, 505, 451, 1723, 505, 7572, 304, 13978, 23228, 26999, 310, 29199, 869, 402, 798, 386, 19257, 310, 714, 11235, 7307, 525, 29879, 505, 1063, 5734, 519, 304, 1906, 472, 2919, 24388, 297, 1570, 3088, 4412, 322, 10059, 869, 3118, 18036, 537, 297, 278, 323, 9097, 7457, 756, 1063, 393, 263, 7282, 5253, 310, 7307, 29199, 505, 2041, 515, 2106, 322, 1887, 5874, 284, 10340, 30003, 12717, 697, 29899, 22585, 310, 278, 3001, 14321, 297, 7307, 525, 29879, 869, 910, 2752, 310, 29199, 723, 2833, 304, 367, 9078, 1919, 577, 393, 5434, 14321, 310, 7307, 525, 29879, 1122, 5232, 869, 19454, 278, 10952, 14321, 310, 7307, 525, 269, 1919, 1556, 310, 278, 7457, 24388, 577, 2215, 505, 26060, 9124, 29899, 3470, 2638, 403, 12128, 5650, 408, 263, 2752, 310, 29199, 869, 3118, 2919, 27415, 4977, 9124, 1919, 3138, 1919, 338, 32007, 32001, 8853, 18616, 2073, 1115, 448, 29900, 29889, 29945, 29913], 'total_duration': 667722000, 'load_duration': 5740200, 'prompt_eval_count': 360, 'prompt_eval_duration': 360683000, 'eval_count': 10, 'eval_duration': 299919000}",0.2,0.3,0.2,-0.5,-0.3,-1.0,-1,0.5,0.2
9,"be delivered on the east coast at substantially lower prices than could domestic crude . This price differential discouraged domestic exploration for oil . With the recent difficulties in the mid-east , tanker rates have increased by as much as 300 per cent , and imported crude now sells at about 75 cents per barrel above domestic crude on the east coast . Thus , domestic crude prices are under pressure , and at least one oil company has announced price increases in the Tenth District . Business is slow for District farm implement dealers . Inventories are relatively large , and cases of price cutting are not uncommon . Collections on credit sales are reported to be noticeably slower than last year . The interrelatedness of Tenth District economic activity with both national and international business conditions is illustrated by the experience of a Kansas City manufacturer of bottling and automatic vending equipment . This firm 's total business is about unchanged from a year ago , with increasing international business about offsetting a definite decline in domestic sales . The decline in domestic sales is attributed to reduced overtime and lower employment in factories with vending machines , as vending machine operators drop routes and defer the purchase of new equipment . There is some concern within the firm that their growing international business will be hurt by retaliations against U. S. restrictions on imports .

10,"this expectation primarily on the fact that about 40 percent of GM 's production workers are under 25 years old , and these workers tend to be more militant than the older workers . If his expectation is borne out , GM dealers in the District will probably run short of parts and new autos , as inventory shortages are already becoming apparent . The Northwest Airlines strike is also having scattered effects throughout the District . A few firms servicing Northwest Airlines have furloughed employees , and a number of retail establishments have experienced noticeable sales reductions . In addition , Northwest Airlines has cut their flight schedules because of the strike , and as a result landing fees to a number of airports in the District have been drastically reduced . These landing fees are important contributions to airport sinking funds , and in at least one case so far , these reductions have become especially troublesome . Ninth District bankers are still experiencing strong demands for loanable funds , according to information gathered during go-around sessions with both directors and officers of this bank . The continued strong loan demand seems to be general throughout the District as no one cited a case where loan demand had diminished . On the contrary , numerous instances were cited where demand had actually strengthened and non-financial businesses had taken further steps to economize on the use of funds .

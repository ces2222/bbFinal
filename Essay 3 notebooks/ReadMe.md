## Essay 3 notebook descriptions

* topical_analysis_following_Filippou.ipynb - running Probit models
* Beige_Topic_Analysis.ipynb - graphs for topic counts, etc. in essay 3 (has section for Granger causality at end if needed)
* Beige_sentiment_and_topics.ipynb - combines sentiment with topics. Includes interactions with topic variables, which I created but did not end up using; can come back here if needed. 2/7/2025 - Added scatter plots of topics and sentiment with recessions to the bottom of this file
* topic_labels_finetuned.ipynb - Fine tunes the Beige Bert model to identify topics; Only need if have to retrain model; includes some additional metrics for training the model that I did not use; 
* topical_analysis_probit_figures.ipynb - These are most of the figures used in the document.
* topical_analysis_probit.ipynb - Does the main probit analysis
* Beige_topic_labeler.ipynb - This is where the pre-trained BERT model labels the topic counts. No reason to re-run unless have to redo it.
* embeddings_database_search_use.ipynb - This allows searching the Beige Books using word embeddings. Very helpful.
* embeddings_database_search_training.ipynb - I believe this generates the embeddings used in 3.11 to do searches. No reason to re-run this.
* topical_analysis_random_forest.ipynb - Runs the topical analysis but uses a random forest model instead of probit

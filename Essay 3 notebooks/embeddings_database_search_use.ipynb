The gloom stems from the view that the current dip in the economy will develop into an all-out recession . Another cause of this gloom is the feeling that inflation can not be stopped without a serious recession . Two industrialists on the board , however , do not share this pessimistic sentiment . One indicated that he saw some further slowing in the pace of business activity , but believed that a recession would be avoided largely because of a pickup in consumer spending .

There will be a correction as soon as the money aggregates return to roughly target levels . Wojnilower : The current business situation appears flat and slightly up . Businessmen , except in the housing and auto industries , are virtually unanimous in their optimism about the short and long run business outlook . Financial markets are more than ever preoccupied with day to day swings in security prices .</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>1978_bo (6)_chunk_2.txt</td><td>0.9435</td><td>through the first week of July . The tourist industry in northern New England is faring very well . Retailers are somewhat apprehensive about the future course of the economy and some feel that inventories may be a bit high ; but this concern is not based on actual experience . Both a major department store chain and a large utility report that uncollectible bills and bad debts , which increase as the economy weakens , are low and falling . The region 's economists are , for the most part , considerably more pessimistic about the economic outlook than are most businessmen . At a recent gathering of business economists nine out of twelve assigned a probability in excess of 50 percent to the prospect of a recession in late 1978 or early 1979 . Consumer debt , the rate of inflation and the Federal Reserve 's response were the basis for their gloomy forecasts . Professors Eckstein and Samuelson were available for comment this month . Both respondents agree that there is a very real possibility of a `` credit crunch '' developing in the second half of this year , although neither believes that the present level of interest rates will necessarily lead to this outcome . They also agreed that while an overly ambitious attempt to slow the rate of money growth could easily produce a recession , the economy 's prospects in the absence of this policy are for slower but still acceptable real growth in the months immediately ahead .</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>1970_ph (8)_chunk_2.txt</td><td>0.9461</td><td>the year . The expectations of area economists for the second half of 1970 parallel those of manufacturing executives . The consensus view of business and bank economists in the Third District , according to a recent poll , is that the current downturn in business activity is bottoming out and that by fall the economy will be expanding once more . Prices , say regional economists , will continue their upward climb , but at a modestly reduced rate as the year progresses . Comments on the current scene by members of the board of directors are varied . Two members , a banker and a utilities executive , indicate that sentiment among their associates has become rather gloomy in recent weeks . The gloom stems from the view that the current dip in the economy will develop into an all-out recession . Another cause of this gloom is the feeling that inflation can not be stopped without a serious recession . Two industrialists on the board , however , do not share this pessimistic sentiment . One indicated that he saw some further slowing in the pace of business activity , but believed that a recession would be avoided largely because of a pickup in consumer spending . The other industrialist expected no further declines in the volume of business . He indicated , though , that he was less certain about the economy and more confused now than at anytime in his experience . Further , this industrialist is skeptical about the ability</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>1977_bo (3)_chunk_2.txt</td><td>0.9521</td><td>as a whole to be fairly strong . According to area bankers commercial loan demand continues to be quite strong . Deposit inflows are healthy although NOW account activity makes it difficult to determine exactly what is happening . A director who runs an employment service reports that demand for workers is strong but that he has difficulty getting unskilled workers who have basic skills . No respondents reported any problems in obtaining materials nor were any anticipating difficulties with bottlenecks . Several respondents indicated that the pace of price increases had moderated significantly . Finally several directors expressed concern over the amount of uncertainty in the economy because of the energy package and the forthcoming tax reform proposals . Professors Eckstein , Houthakker , and Samuelson were contacted this month . Samuelson notes that a large majority of professional forecasters anticipate real growth of between 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 percent over the six-quarter period ending in 1978 . The exceptions , along with most nonprofessional estimates , are lower and are presumably based on the expectation that the lack of economic vigor will ignite inventory decumulation . The anticipated economic climate is reminiscent of 1974 , when several quarters of sluggish growth culminated in a collapse in demand . All forecasts fall well below the 5 percent real growth target that Samuelson finds economically and politically desirable . Samuelson and Eckstein both eschewed the Shadow FOMC 's recommendation of a one-shot $ 4 billion drop in Ml to return to the target path .</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>1971_ph (12)_chunk_3.txt</td><td>0.9775</td><td>which remain outstanding . The businesses to whom these commitments have been made are still looking around for permanent financing , however . Apparently they are shopping for funds with more favorable terms . This shopping around may mean that some people in the construction industry believe that further declines in interest rates are in the wind . Although there appears to be less pessimism in general now than a few weeks ago in the Third District , most businessmen still express a deep concern about inflation and unemployment . Nonetheless , a feeling seems to be emerging in the business community that the '' worst is behind us and somehow things will work out for the best . ''</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>1974_ph (3)_chunk_3.txt</td><td>0.9777</td><td>Virtually no new business is being accepted , and well established customers are required to show that their loans are intended for `` productive '' rather than speculative uses . The lending restrictions have not been directed at any one class of business borrowers . Finally , inflation shows no sign of abating . The glimmers of hope reported last month have all but disappeared from the results of our latest outlook survey . The businessmen anticipating higher prices for both the goods they buy and the ones they sell outnumber those expecting prices to hold steady by more than two to one . Only a handful of respondents expect any reduction in prices by next March . It looks like inflation psychology is well entrenched and will not soon be dislodged .</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>1973_ri (12)_chunk_3.txt</td><td>0.9794</td><td>bankers in the District remain optimistic about the general economic outlook . More than 60 percent of the banking respondents expect an improvement in business activity in their areas in the immediate future . Optimism about the business outlook among textile producers seems especially high .</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>1970_ph (1)_chunk_1.txt</td><td>0.9833</td><td>December 9 , 1970 There is general agreement among directors , bankers , manufacturers , retailers , and business economists in the Third District that the economy will remain sluggish through the end of the year . For 1971 , there is cautious optimism for a mild pickup in business activity . However , few people that we talked with believe that the `` worst of both worlds '' situation will improve much next year . The consensus is that both unemployment and inflation will remain at unacceptable rates throughout the year . Because of this feeling among area businessmen , there is a growing willingness to try an incomes policy . The level of business activity is expected to remain flat or decrease slightly through the end of this year , according to regional manufacturers . Our latest reading of business sentiment in the District shows that most area manufacturers experienced either no change or actual decline in sales and new orders for the month of November . For December , the consensus view is for no change in these key variables . Looking ahead to 1971 , however , optimism remains for at least a mild upturn in the economy . Most manufacturers say they expect volume to increase over the next six months . However , because the pickup in the economy is expected to be slow , area manufacturers are holding the line on capital spending plans . On the whole , the outlook for spending on new plant and equipment is</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>1977_bo (3)_chunk_3.txt</td><td>0.9855</td><td>Both are convinced this policy would result in a severe credit crunch and a recession . `` It 's hard to envision a worse policy , '' according to Eckstein . Each fears that a highly restrictive monetary policy will trigger massive tax reductions which , in combination , would be `` disastrous '' for capital expenditures . Professor Houthakker finds no fault with the present long-run monetary growth targets . He urges a stronger effort to achieve the present targets . He notes that the outlook for the current account in 1978 is `` not good '' but believes it can be financed by the combination of higher interest rates here and lower rates abroad .</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>1971_ri (4)_chunk_3.txt</td><td>0.9991</td><td>a sizable jump in the number of respondents expecting improvement in general economic conditions in the near future . More than half the banking respondents now fall into this category .</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>1978_ph (1)_chunk_2.txt</td><td>0.9999</td><td>. For the longer term , manufacturers are generally bearish about future economic conditions . They look for a further slowing of business activity between now and June , with no change in the level of new orders and only a fractional increase in shipments . Consistent with this outlook for production is the forecast of no growth in the size of factory payrolls over the next two quarters along with further cuts in the length of the workweek . A Director of this Bank , whose business is in the manufacturing sector , agrees that the outlook for 1979 is `` shaky . '' In fact , his company is budgeting for a recession next year . He sees a downturn as a virtual certainty and says the only questions are when it will come and how deep it will be . Inflation in the industrial sector continues in December . Over 60 percent of the manufacturers polled this month report higher prices for inputs , while about 30 percent are charging more for their finished products . As for the future , the executives surveyed look for price hikes to become more widespread over the next six months . Eighty-six percent of the respondents expect their costs to go up in the first half of 1979 , and about 65 percent plan to raise the prices of the goods they sell in that period . Sales at area department stores are extremely slow so far in December , but retailers are looking for a</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>1977_bo (10)_chunk_4.txt</td><td>1.0016</td><td>exogenous price increases . He believes `` this is no time to put the economy through another wringer . . .do n't meet irrational apprehensions by sacrificing real growth . '' He suspects that money growth may have to exceed stated targets in 1977 ; otherwise , the risks of jeopardizing real growth in 1978 are considerable . Solow believes that the permanent effects of winter will be small , and , if interest rates remain fairly constant for the next 6 to 9 months , real growth during 1977 will average 5.5 to 6 percent . He would be `` appalled '' if rising interest rates jeopardized even this modest growth performance . Only if inflation were increasing rapidly at the end of the year , should tighter monetary policy lead to increasing interest rates . It would take another recession to push inflation below the 5 to 6 percent range , and that is more than a depressed economy should pay . Eckstein believes that an unremitting flow of good news is required if conventional forecasts are to be realized . Hence , new investment survey data merely support the outlook , they do not indicate a boom . A major concern is that policy-makers should not get excited about dilemmas until they are at hand . `` Monetary policy should let the economy move into a period of stimulus leaving the money and credit system alone . '' Until there is evidence that fiscal policy threatens an unmanageable boom , the Federal Reserve</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>2000_ph (4)_chunk_5.txt</td><td>1.0030</td><td>. Although most expect economic conditions in the region to remain good , they anticipate some slowing in business expansion . They forecast an easing from the current rate of growth in business loans and a decline in commercial and residential real estate lending . They expect current trends in consumer lending to continue , with rising credit card lending but no growth in other types of consumer loans .</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>1977_bo (7)_chunk_4.txt</td><td>1.0090</td><td>various raw materials markets which serve as a good leading indicator of inflation . The world economy is still growing slowly but is no cause for alarm . On the basis of the recent economic data , Professor Samuelson would favor some tightening provided that policymakers are willing to reverse course subsequently if economic targets are not being met . Specifically , Samuelson feels that annual real growth of less than 5 percent over the next six quarters would be politically unacceptable . While a prestigious minority of forecasters expect this goal to be met , the consensus forecast is of somewhat slower growth over that period . Samuelson 's philosophy is that a `` zig-zag '' policy , such as tightening now and reversing if the optimistic forecasts gets marked down , is not fine-tuning ( which implies perfect command ) . Zig-zagging around the desirable range as new information accumulates is , to the contrary , the optimal policy posture in a changing world filled with uncertainty .</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>1981_cl (7)_chunk_2.txt</td><td>1.0110</td><td>to the median forecast , are expected to accelerate to about 4 % and 5 % in the fourth quarter of 1981 and the first quarter of 1982 , respectively . Prices and Output Round Table economists were sympathetic with , but doubtful of , the Reagan scenario for prices and output into the mid- 1980s . A bank economist pointed to an inconsistency between a projected decline in money stock growth and double-digit growth rates in nominal GNP during 1981-84 , implying faster-than-trend growth in velocity . He acknowledged that even his projections of growth in output of 3 % to 31/2 % and 4 % to 5 % in the GNP price deflator by 1984 imply somewhat above-trend growth in velocity . Another economist asserted that the Administration 's projected growth in output might be achieved and that price performance may be somewhat better than in the Reagan scenario until 1983-84 , when supply constraints would reverse the near-term moderating trend in prices . Optimism over the price outlook stems from an expected cyclical recovery in productivity , supported by deregulations that will improve cost performance and by less intense pressure from COLA clauses as inflation begins to unwind . Consumer Spending Recovery in real retail sales in the Fourth District has been weak and well below the national average because of softness in the District 's economy . An economist associated with a major national department store chain expects retail sales in the District to continue to be sluggish . Nationally , he</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>1970_sf (3)_chunk_4.txt</td><td>1.0149</td><td>buyers out of the market than the scarcity and high rates of mortgage finance . In conclusion , businessmen and bankers in the Twelfth District expect that economic conditions will hold for the moment at the current slower pace and that there has been no basic change in either the business or financial situation .</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>1990_bo (7)_chunk_3.txt</td><td>1.0157</td><td>specific markets . Almost one-half of the firms are offering discounts in those markets where competition is particularly stiff ; however , an equal number reported price increases . Employment levels are reportedly flat to down for most respondents . Several firms have made or plan substantial layoffs . By contrast , two manufacturers have recently increased employment , but their gains are small compared with the layoffs reported elsewhere . One-third of the respondents plan capital expenditures 15 to 50 percent below 1989 levels ; however , an equal number expect to increase capital spending - in some cases , quite significantly . Investment goals include retooling for new products , expansions and a few new facilities . Manufacturers were divided in their assessment of the future . Almost half of the manufacturing contacts expect faster growth in 1990 than occurred in 1989 ( with anticipated sales gain ranging up to 12 percent and profitability improving even more ) . The balance foresee sluggish growth at best . Members of this more pessimistic group describe themselves as `` sober '' and anticipate a `` rough '' couple of years for themselves and their industries . Several respondents ( from among both optimists and pessimists ) suggested that the state of the regional economy `` feels worse than it really is '' and that the `` doom and gloom talk is exaggerated .</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>1980_ns (4)_chunk_5.txt</td><td>1.0174</td><td>expects the economy to begin recovering next quarter , despite the backup in interest rates which , he says , is slowing the reliquefaction of businesses .

Manufacturing contacts indicate that employment levels are generally rising , but in contrast to retailers , few found labor markets tight or wage pressures mounting . While inventories are considered a bit high , they are not seen as worrisome . In most cases , capital spending continues at last year 's pace , with productivity increases and expansion the primary goals . Half the respondents expect a recession or significant slowdown within the next months . The others see favorable prospects for themselves and the economy . Even among the optimistic , however , caution prevails . For example , one corporate economist is concerned that economic activity may be less robust than widely believed because the prolonged fall in computer prices is distorting measured growth in `` real '' investment and GNP . Another respondent is `` nervous '' that talk of recession will prove self-fulfilling . A third who sees no evidence of recession has nevertheless counseled his management to `` tread water . '' As one manufacturer who usually describes himself as `` cautiously optimistic '' put it , `` Now I 'm just plain cautious . '' Residential Real Estate Some residential realtors in the First District say activity has slowed recently ; others , with an earlier summer sales peak , noted a slowdown in August and moderate comeback in the past few weeks .

'' An independent oil producer claims that there is currently an oversupply of petroleum products in the United States . He avers that most major oil companies are using devious methods to hide their true net income figures . Overall , there appears to be a feeling of dismay and helplessness over the direction the economy is to take . One banker states , `` there are growing fears that very high financial costs , pervasive loss of liquidity , slow economic growth world-wide , and much deep negative psychology will cause a new economic downturn soon unless policy changes are made to improve confidence . ''</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>1981_cl (7)_chunk_1.txt</td><td>1.0219</td><td>March 25 , 1981 Summary Respondents in the Fourth District expect output next quarter will probably weaken from the first quarter and indeed may decline , but they forecast a more rapid recovery in the second half of 1981 than projected by the Reagan Administration . Near-term inflation may also improve more than indicated in the Administration scenario . Retail sales in the District remain weak , except for auto sales , which have improved in response to widespread rebate programs . Steel orders and shipments are holding up well . Although capital-goods spending has not yet turned around , some signs of bottoming out are reported . Housing is weak , but industry officials foresee declining mortgage rates in the second quarter of 1981 . Outlook The Fourth District Round Table forecasts of 28 economists on March 13 , 1981 , were generally more optimistic for 1981 than indicated in the Reagan scenario . The median forecast shows growth in real GNP of about 2.4 % between the fourth quarter of 1980 and the fourth quarter of 1981 , but with an increase in the implicit price deflator of 9.4 % and an unemployment rate of 7.5 % in the fourth quarter of 1981 .
